<span class="fs70">THE ROUTE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Poor old Larkins and his wife were completely
broken by Mimie’s terrible mishap.
They could not find it in their hearts to
speak harshly of their unhappy child; but
they were loudly indignant against the man
who had tempted her to leave her home.
Herbert, too, came in for his share of their
reproaches, when he confessed that he had
been for some time aware of the intimacy
between Mimie and Ernest Farrington, and
had long dreaded some such catastrophe.</p>

<p>‘Oh, Herbert!’ Mrs. Larkins had said to
him more than once, ‘to think you should<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>
have seen her in such danger, and never to
let on a word. I thought better of you&mdash;after
all&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I know I am greatly to blame, mother.
You cannot say anything harder of me than
I do of myself. But she promised me never&mdash;never
to meet him again, and I trusted
her. Wasn’t it natural?’</p>

<p>‘Trust her? I’d have trusted her with
untold gold. I thought she was as good as
gold herself, and better. That’s what stings
me. To think that she should have held
herself so cheap as to be led astray by such
a fellow as that, and a Farrington, too.’</p>

<p>‘Farrington or no Farrington, he shall
answer for this to me, mother, and that I
swear.’</p>

<p>‘Hush, Herbert lad, remember who he
is, and who you are.’</p>

<p>‘I warned him that if she came to any<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>
harm, I’d be even with him, and I will, so
help me Heaven,’</p>

<p>‘Don’t, Herbert, don’t talk like that.
You might be court-martialled, and for ever
disgraced, even for those words. Do you
think he will not be punished some day as
he deserves, and that, whether you raise a
little finger against him or no? We must
leave him in other hands.’</p>

<p>Mrs. Larkins’ resignation hardly chimed
in with Herbert’s impetuous mood.</p>

<p>‘I’d be after him now; aye, although
I’m a soldier, and tied by the leg. I’d
show a clean pair of heels, only&mdash;’</p>

<p>It was clear that desertion was in his
mind.</p>

<p>‘Promise me, Herbert, swear to me,
Herbert, that you will do nothing rash.
Don’t desert your colours. Don’t forget
your sacred duty, even for us.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I had made up my mind to follow them
last night. I could have got a passage
home, and plain clothes and everything,
but the steamer did not start, and to-day
it’s too late.’</p>

<p>‘Too late? Thank God for that; but
why?’</p>

<p>‘Haven’t you heard the news, mother?’
Then he bethought himself that in her
grievous trial there was but little likelihood
of the gossip of the garrison reaching her
ears.</p>

<p>‘The route’s in,’ Herbert went on, using
the catch phrase of the soldier. ‘The regiment’s
under orders for active service, and
we start directly the steamer arrives.’</p>

<p>‘Start? For where?’</p>

<p>‘Ashanti. It was in orders last night,
and the generals coming to inspect us this
afternoon, with the P.M.O., to see who’s fit<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>
for service and who’s not. The whole barrack’s
upside down. Officers and men mad
with delight. So should I be for this
chance, which may not come twice.’</p>

<p>‘Mayhap when you meet him next it will
be on more equal terms.’</p>

<p>‘Aye, but when will that be? I may
have to wait months before I get my
knuckles at his throat.’</p>

<p>‘Surely these orders will bring him out
to head-quarters at once?’</p>

<p>‘They ought to; but he’s mean enough
to try and shirk the whole business, I’ve
heard officers of the regiment say as much&mdash;and
in any case he can’t arrive before we
start for the Coast.’</p>

<p>The staunch old couple came down
themselves to the new Mole to bid their boy
Godspeed.</p>

<p>‘There’ll be more Larkins’ out there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>
than you, Herkles, boy,’ said the old Sergeant,
with a fierce light in his eye. He
had made no great demonstrations; but
Mimie’s conduct had, perhaps, wounded
him more deeply than his wife. Now, for
a moment, he brightened up like an old
war-horse, but it was with more than the
scent of the coming fray. ‘Rechab’s ship
ordered to the coast, and maybe they’ll
send him ashore with the Naval Brigade.
He’s carpenter’s mate and a right handy
lad. So you’ll foregather, and between you
you might have a chance of bringing yon
scoundrel to book.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll try,’ said Herbert, with his teeth
set.</p>

<p>‘If he’d only make an honest woman of
my sweet bird. If he’d only marry and
behave decently to her.’</p>

<p>‘Decently!’ cried Mrs. Larkins, interposing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>
in a strong indignant voice. ‘Was there
ever a Farrington who behaved decently to
one of us?’</p>

<p>‘I’d like to force him and all his relations
too. But time’s up. God bless you,
mother, and you, sergeant, and bring all
things right in the end.’</p>

<p>With that, amidst thundering cheers
and the invigorating strains of ‘Auld Lang
Syne’ and ‘The Girl I left behind me,’ the
good ship slowly got under weigh.</p>

<p>It is no part of my intention to dilate
upon the events of the Ashanti war. It will
be in all men’s minds how early mischances
brought the enemy close to our gates and
rendered imperative the despatch of some
capable leader to grapple with the emergency;
how Sir Garnet Wolseley, the hero
of the hour, accompanied by a brilliant
staff, was desired to drive back the foe<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>
with such forces as he found to his hand;
how Fantee allies proved the most despicable
cowards, and the small force of British
seamen and marines were clearly unequal
single-handed to the task of marching upon
Coomassie, the objective point; how the
demand for British regiments was at length
complied with by the home Government,
and how, when these had arrived and all
was ready for the forward movement, a
sudden collapse in transport arrangements
threatened to paralyse the whole of the
operations. Hence it was that the British
regiments were not immediately disembarked,
but cruised the seas till a new and
more vigorous organisation of transport
could be devised and carried out. We will
take up the thread of our narrative at a
time when the little invading army was
across the Prah and almost within striking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
distance of Coomassie. No serious collision
with the enemy had as yet occurred, but
some sharp fighting was obviously imminent.
It was thought that the Ashantis
would hold the Adansi Hills, and, even if
forced therefrom, would make more than
one subsequent stand; and it was probable
that by nothing less than obstinate fighting
would the ends of the campaign be
achieved.</p>

<p>They had been long days of weary
waiting for all concerned. The country
was hateful and noxious in the extreme; yet
all fought bravely, not against the foe, with
whom they had scarcely been pitted, but
against the malaria, the ever present fever,
the intolerable heat. None behaved more
pluckily than the Duke’s Own. Wellington
once said, ‘Give me the dandies for
hard work,’ and the apothegm might be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
extended, into including crack corps. Now
that they were at the real business of war,
they bore hardships, privations and continuous
discomfort without a murmur. The
once splendid mess was now represented by
a scratch meal under the fetich tree of a
deserted village; its entertainments were
to offer to comrades a cup of chocolate, a
slice of tinned meat or sardine <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au naturel</i>
upon biscuit instead of toast. Luxury was
a thing forgotten by all. Days of toilsome
marching through the interminable forest,
nights in drenching rain, with short commons
in almost everything except quinine,
were but poor substitutes for what they
had left behind at Gibraltar and at home.
Yet the Duke’s Own took everything as it
came, indulging only in the occasional
grumble which is deemed the British soldier’s
birthright, and which, if nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
else, is an outlet and safety-valve for discontent.</p>

<p>But the regiment had suffered considerably
from sickness. Colonel Diggle was
down with fever. He had been one of the
first attacked, and though he had borne up
with all the fortitude he could muster, his
nature was not of that resolute kind which
successfully resists disease. Very soon
after disembarkation he had succumbed,
and while he was lying in his cot on board
the hospital ship Major Greathed had the
honour of commanding the Duke’s Own in
the field. Several other officers were also
on the sick list, and a large percentage of
the rank and file. Among the latter was
Herbert Larkins.</p>

<p>He had fought with extraordinary pluck
against the insidious advances of the fever.
He had doctored himself, had taken quarts<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of quinine, had refused persistently to seek
for medical advice lest he should be struck
off duty and sent to hospital. With it all
he had stuck manfully to his work&mdash;no
easy task&mdash;for during a portion of the time
the quartermaster-sergeant had been <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors
de combat</i>, and Greathed had selected Herbert
to act in his place. All this told on
him.</p>

<p>One day after many hours’ unremitting
toil whipping up the craven carriers who
tardily brought forward the regimental
supplies, followed by long labours in issuing
rations, Herbert suddenly dropped as if he
had been shot through the head. They laid
him in a hammock and carried him with
them for a time, as they were then approaching
the Adansi Hills, and an action
seemed imminent. Nothing of the kind, as
is well known, occurred. After a short<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>
breathing space the advance was resumed.
Herbert, who had at length recovered consciousness,
saw to his mortification the regiment
march out of the village in which
they had been encamped, while he was left
with a score or so of sick and helpless behind.
It was the more aggravating because
the crisis of the campaign was seemingly
near at hand. Coomassie itself was not
more than five and twenty or thirty miles
distant; the enemy was known to be in
force in front and in flank. Fighting more
or less severe there must be, and that very
soon. To think that he should miss it after
all!</p>

<p>But, as will be seen, Herbert’s luck
was not entirely against him. Young,
strong, and sound as a bell, he had rallied
wonderfully from his attack, and was already
on the high road to convalescence<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>
within a day or two of the regiment’s departure.</p>

<p>‘If ye gae on like this, ye’ll be as fit as
a fiddle in a week,’ the Scotch doctor said.</p>

<p>‘And when may I go to the front,
sir?’</p>

<p>‘At once, if the commanding officer
here’ll let you.’</p>

<p>Herbert almost jumped off his bed, and
hurriedly smartened himself as well as he
could, to appear before the commandant.</p>

<p>But on leaving the hospital, a substantial
building which had evidently been the
palace of an Ashanti chief, he found the
little garrison which held the village&mdash;I will
call it Yankowfum&mdash;in a state of agitation,
almost uproar. Important news had come
back from the front. There had been
a great battle (Amoaful). We had won it,
but not without serious losses. The enemy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
was still full of fight. A special despatch
had been received by the commandant at
Yankowfum to be on the look-out. His
and the other posts along the line of advance
would probably be attacked in force,
and the Ashantis must be driven back at
all costs. This, with many additions, had
gone forth among the handful of sailors
and West Indians composing the garrison,
and was being loudly discussed when
Herbert appeared.</p>

<p>‘Where’s the commandant?’ Herbert
asked. ‘Who is he?’</p>

<p>‘Don’t know his name; he’s one of your
lot,’ said an A.B.</p>

<p>‘And a poor lot, too, I take it,’ said
another, ‘to judge by his looks and his
ways.’</p>

<p>Herbert was about to retort, when a
black soldier in his picturesque Zouave<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
dress came up, and said, ‘Staff colonel one
time come. Very much angry with buckra
officer.’</p>

<p>It was the officer in general charge of
the communications who had hastened back
from Amoaful to look to the security of his
posts. He was travelling almost alone in a
hammock carried by bearers, and seemed
to think nothing of the dangers he braved
as he passed through the bush swarming
with enemies.</p>

<p>He was apparently seeking to infuse
some of his own spirit into the commandant
of Yankowfum.</p>

<p>‘You’ll do it easily enough,’ Herbert
heard him say as he approached them,
meaning to offer his services. ‘This place
is stockaded, you’ve got a garrison.’</p>

<p>‘But it’s so small,’ said the other, ‘not
fifty men, and half of them blacks.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span></p>

<p>That voice? Surely it was familiar,
Herbert thought.</p>

<p>‘I can’t give you another man. There
isn’t time. Besides, every other post is
threatened. However, you’ve got your
orders; you must hold out to the last,
you understand?’ said the colonel, pretty
sharply.</p>

<p>‘But, sir, it’s not fair upon us. I must
really protest. We shall be cut to pieces.
What can such a handful do? For God’s
sake don’t leave us like this&mdash;’</p>

<p>The other turned on his heel, but
stopped short to say,</p>

<p>‘Upon my word, Mr.&mdash;Mr.&mdash;Farrington&mdash;I
cannot compliment you on your demeanour.
If there was another officer
within reach I’d relieve you of your command.
I wish even there was a steady old
sergeant or two&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span></p>

<p>Then his eye fell upon Herbert, who
had moved a little farther away during the
foregoing colloquy, partly because he felt
that he ought not to overhear the colonel’s
strictures, and partly because he was greatly
excited at this unexpected rencontre with
Ernest Farrington.</p>

<p>‘Ah, a sergeant, a colour-sergeant too?
You have heard, no doubt? The post is
about to be attacked. I have been telling
the commandant here he must draw in the
line of defence. Be careful not to waste
ammunition, and hold on like grim death.
You understand?’</p>

<p>‘All right, sir,’ answered Herbert
cheerily, and the colonel went off, probably
a little happier in his mind.</p>

<p>‘Any further orders, sir?’ Herbert
quietly asked of Ernest Farrington, who
was ashen pale, and too much agitated<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
seemingly to recognise the man who spoke
to him.</p>

<p>‘No, no; do the best you can, sergeant.’</p>

<p>Whereat Herbert saluted and walked
off.</p>

<p>It would be time enough to settle their
differences by and bye. Perhaps by nightfall
neither of them would be alive.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE VICTORIA CROSS.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">A stout and substantial stockade of bamboos,
having loopholes and a shallow ditch,
surrounded the village of Yankowfum, and
seemed sufficient if it were only manned
throughout to keep out any attacking force.
But the little garrison was not strong
enough to occupy more than a third of its
length. It was a question, therefore, whether
it would not be wisest to limit the
defence, and, instead of holding the outer
and too extended line, concentrate the whole
force within the hospital building, which
was certainly large, but still compact and
reasonably strong. This is what our hero
had to decide, for it was upon Herbert that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
the responsibility seemed to fall. Ernest
Farrington was almost helpless, whether
from abject incapacity, or from the more
despicable reason of total want of nerve.
Besides, after what the staff colonel had
said Herbert felt that he was bound to act
and do the best he could.</p>

<p>He consulted with one or two of the
others, particularly an old lance-sergeant
who deferred to him as senior in rank, and
a very smart young sailor, a petty officer,
who, like every true blue jacket, was ready
to put his hand to anything.</p>

<p>‘Best hold on to the front line at least
for a bit,’ the lance-sergeant thought. ‘We
can fall back upon the hospital if we’re hard
pressed.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, I agree to that,’ replied Herbert.
‘But the hospital will be our real centre
and chief defence. It must be strengthened,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>
barricaded, the walls pierced with loopholes,
and the thatch taken off the roof for fear of
fire. Who’ll see to all that? will you?’ he
asked of the sailor.</p>

<p>‘Aye will I. Give me half a dozen
hands, that’s all. Them blacks’ll do. I’m
rated carpenter’s mate, and I can show them
how to work. I’ll make everything taut
and shipshape, or my name’s not Rechab
Larkins.’</p>

<p>‘Rechab Lar&mdash;’ Herbert’s jaw dropped
with amazement. ‘Son of the barrack sergeant,
once at Triggertown and now at Gib?’</p>

<p>The other nodded.</p>

<p>‘Do you know who I am? Why&mdash;Hercules
Albert, your half-brother.’</p>

<p>It was Rechab’s turn to show astonishment.</p>

<p>‘Avast there. None of your games. <em>You</em>
little Herkles boy?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Yes. You may take your oath, to that.’</p>

<p>‘Well; I <em>am</em> blowed.’</p>

<p>Then they shook hands warmly and
looked at each other, and shook hands
again and again.</p>

<p>‘Come, lads,’ interposed the lance-sergeant,
‘time’s up. Don’t get looking for
the strawberry marks, or may be the niggers
will drop on to you and save you all
the trouble.’</p>

<p>‘You’re right,’ said Herbert promptly.
‘All this will keep. Now, Rechab, lad, to
your post. There’s more to tell you, but
that, too, will keep.’</p>

<p>Why tell him that Ernest Farrington
was also there sharing their danger?</p>

<p>Herbert, following the lance-sergeant’s
advice, resolved to hold the stockade, but at
its angles and points only, whence a fairly
good flanking fire across the front could be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
maintained. At each of these he posted a
small detachment under the command of a
non-commissioned officer, to whom he gave
explicit orders. They were to save ammunition,
to ‘fire slow and fire low,’ as the
general said, and hold on till they got the
signal to retire. This would be passed
from the centre the moment the stockade
was forced at any point. The retreat was
to be made with all speed upon the hospital
under cover of its fire. At the hospital
itself a small garrison was also posted from
the first, composed of the convalescents; of
all, in fact, who had spirit enough to rise
from their beds. Even Dr. McCosh got out
his revolver and promised to assist. None
of the sick were strong enough to form part of
the outer line, nor could they have retreated
rapidly when that line was broken through,
but they would be able to load and fire alternately<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
standing and sitting, and so contribute
much to the general inner defence.</p>

<p>When these dispositions were in a fair
way towards completion, Herbert went in
search of his commanding officer to report
progress.</p>

<p>‘Will you inspect the post, sir? Everything
is as ready as we can make it. We
only want the enemy now, and they can
come on as soon as they please.’</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington winced slightly at the
mention of the enemy, but he was now far
more master of himself than when Herbert
had seen him last. He had pulled himself
together, and seemed about to take his
proper position as commanding officer and
chief. Like many other weak spirits, he
made up for former shortcomings by assuming
a blustering air.</p>

<p>‘I daresay you have done your best.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
We shall see. Where are the men posted?
At the stockade? Oh, this won’t do at all.
We cannot hold the stockade; we are too
few. The hospital is our only chance.
Everyone must be concentrated there.’</p>

<p>‘But, sir, we cannot resign the stockade
without a shot.’</p>

<p>‘Do you dispute my orders? I’ll put
you under arrest, and have you tried for
mutinous conduct. Who are you? What’s
your name?’</p>

<p>‘I am Colour-Sergeant Larkins, of the
Duke’s Own.’</p>

<p>‘Larkins? Larkins? What Larkins?
Not Mi&mdash;Mi&mdash;Mimie’s brother?’</p>

<p>‘Her half-brother, Mr. Farrington, who
told you not so long ago that if you injured
her he would break every bone in your
skin. Her own brother is here, too.
What’s to hinder us from putting a bullet<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>
through you now, you white-livered
cur?’</p>

<p>‘How dare you address me like that?
I’ll have you placed in irons. You shall be
charged with mutiny, by George. I’ll get
you shot.’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps the Ashantis will save you&mdash;and
me&mdash;the trouble,’ said Herbert, significantly.
‘But if we get through this day
all right, you and I have other differences
to settle, remember that.’</p>

<p>‘Threats? This is insufferable. I’ll
shove you in arrest; I’ll put a sentry over
you.’</p>

<p>Farrington suddenly turned quite white;
his teeth chattered, and he could hardly
stand.</p>

<p>‘What in heaven’s name is that?’ he
stammered out.</p>

<p>A roar of voices, harsh, discordant, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>
loud enough to rouse the dead. It was the
Ashanti song of battle, sung by thousands,
as it seemed, uniting into one grand but savage
chorus of defiance. Behind all was the
hideous noise of screeching horns and the
rattle of native drums. For some minutes
the uproar continued, then ceased as suddenly
as it had arisen. It was followed by
a sound more familiar and far more impressive,
at least in a soldier’s ears. This was
the sharp and sustained crackling of musketry
fire.</p>

<p>The ball had begun.</p>

<p>‘Our quarrel will keep, sir. There’s
something else to be done now. Any
orders, sir?’</p>

<p>‘No; at least, yes. Perhaps the men
had better stay where they are just at first.
You can withdraw them when you think
you ought. I shall go myself to the hospital.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>
It is more central, and I can see all
around from there.’</p>

<p>And Mr. Farrington, who was becoming
more than uncomfortable as the slugs were
falling rapidly around, went off with rather
indecent haste.</p>

<p>The enemy were still in the bush surrounding
the village, and the garrison had
not yet returned the fire. Emboldened by
this, the Ashantis came out from their
cover, and showed themselves in increasing
numbers all round the stockade. This was
the opportunity for the defenders. At a
signal from Herbert, a well-directed fire
from the several flanks made considerable
havoc, and the Ashantis fell back. They
came on however again and again. Again
and again they were repulsed. But they
were maddened, not disheartened, by their
losses; and once more attacking with determination,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>
at one point carried the stockade.</p>

<p>It was time now to retire upon the hospital.
This was effected rapidly, but without
disorder. The wounded&mdash;happily very
few, so far&mdash;were carried within the walls,
where all who were still sound also took
up their posts. This inner citadel was perhaps
not impregnable, but with resolution
it might be held against very considerable
odds.</p>

<p>‘I told you the stockade should not
have been held,’ some one said to Herbert,
and turning he saw Mr. Farrington, who
had not before shown himself during the
fight.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, sir; if you had
been with us in the front you would have
thought otherwise,’ Herbert answered,
rather intemperately; but it chafed him to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>
find his officer keeping out of harm’s way.
‘At any rate, we can’t fall back any more.
If the enemy force their way in here, we
are lost men.’</p>

<p>But this the Ashantis could not effect.
They surged up against the walls like waves
upon a rocky headland, only to fall back
like breakers in a thousand drops. They
sought to force the barricades, to escalade
and enter by the roof. Once or twice their
efforts seemed near success, but the obstinate
opposition which they met sent them
reeling back discomfited. At this juncture
Herbert, with the intuitive judgment of the
true general, felt that a counterstroke would
probably give the defenders the day. He
proposed a sally of the whole force, and a
bayonet charge.</p>

<p>‘On no account&mdash;it would be madness,’
said Ernest Farrington, whom he discovered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>
with difficulty ensconced behind some cases
of commissariat stores.</p>

<p>‘What do you say, boys? Shall we
give ’em a touch of the cold steel?’ cried
Herbert.</p>

<p>A hearty cheer was the ready response.</p>

<p>‘Won’t you lead us?’ Herbert said to
Farrington, in a strong accent of scorn.
‘It’s your last chance to retrieve your
character.’</p>

<p>‘I distinctly forbid you to sally. Not
a man shall leave the hospital. Halt! halt!
I say.’</p>

<p>The men were like bloodhounds tearing
frantically at the leash.</p>

<p>‘It’s your last chance,’ Herbert repeated,
as he went close up to Farrington,
and whispered. ‘Your last chance, you
cowardly cur. Come on, or be shamed for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>
ever; a disgrace to your cloth, your regiment,
and a good old name.’</p>

<p>Stung to the quick by these taunts,
Ernest hurriedly drew his sword, and placing
himself at the head of his men, gave the
order to port arms, and prepare to charge.
With a loud ‘hurroosh’ the gallant garrison
rushed out pell-mell, and fell upon their
foe.</p>

<p>The enemy could not face the British
bayonet. They broke even before their
assailants reached them, and fled in disorder
towards the stockade. The garrison
pursued them, Mr. Farrington still leading.
He was like a jibbing horse, which having
long refused to move, at last bolts headlong.
Herbert was also well to the front, but he
saw the danger of pushing the success too
far, and before reaching the stockade he
paused and endeavoured to restrain the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>
men. Many halted at his voice and rallied
round him, but a few more unmanageable
continued to race ahead beyond the stockade
as far as the bush. Mr. Farrington,
half-mad with excitement, was one of these,
and with them he fell into a trap. A number
of Ashantis reinforced, probably from behind,
had rallied just within the bush and
opened a very destructive fire.</p>

<p>Ernest Farrington was the first to fall.
Many others were struck down, and the
too eager band of pursuers were suddenly
effectually checked. But all who could
retired in hot haste upon the main body,
which under Herbert’s command had made
a stand to cover their retreat.</p>

<p>Mr. Farrington was not killed outright.
He was evidently badly wounded, but he
was able to rise to his feet, and strove
feebly to make his way back to the shelter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[35]</a></span>
of the stockade, the enemy slowly ‘potting’
at him as he crawled along.</p>

<p>‘We must bring him in,’ cried Herbert,
hotly. ‘Come on, Rechab; Farrington or
no Farrington&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Is yon Ernest Farrington? Mimie’s&mdash;&mdash;?
Yes? Let him be; let him die the
death. I won’t stir a step to help the
accursed hound.’</p>

<p>Herbert did not wait to hear all Rechab’s
words, but rushed forward alone into the
open. The fire increased in fury, but he
passed through it and reached Ernest’s side,
unscathed.</p>

<p>‘Come on, sir,’ he said; ‘lean on me;
we’ll get back together.’ But almost as he
spoke Ernest fell helplessly, struck by a
second slug.</p>

<p>There was nothing for Herbert but to
lift the inanimate body upon his shoulders<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[36]</a></span>
and stagger back as best he could. He
was himself wounded more than once, but
only slightly, before he regained the stockade,
but still he regained it and laid his
burden safely within.</p>

<p>‘Weel done, mon, weel done,’ said the
surgeon. ‘Let’s see if ye were in time or
no,’ and he proceeded to examine Ernest’s
hurts.</p>

<p>The pain of probing the wounds brought
the unfortunate officer to his senses, and
opening his eyes, he looked wildly around.</p>

<p>‘Larkins, Larkins; is Larkins here?’ he
gasped.</p>

<p>Both who bore that name knelt by his
side, and hung breathlessly upon his words.</p>

<p>‘I loved her. I did, upon my soul.
Tell her I said so with my last words; that
I ask her forgiveness, as I do yours. I
wronged her, but I&mdash;I&mdash;repaired it&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">[37]</a></span></p>

<p>The blood gushed in a torrent from
his mouth, and in another second he was
dead.</p>

<p>The enemy made no further demonstrations
against Yankowfum, and by nightfall
the post had almost regained its normal
condition. It had been an eventful day for
Herbert Larkins, and one likely to lay the
foundation of his fortunes; for his gallant
conduct did not pass unnoticed.</p>

<p>Early the next morning the staff colonel
returned and heard a full account of the
fight. Herbert was too modest to descant
upon his own deeds, but Dr. McCosh and
the others described in glowing terms the
story of the defence and of Herbert’s brave
attempt to save Farrington’s life.</p>

<p>‘You ought to have the Cross for this,’
said the colonel, a quiet self-contained man,
rising for the moment into enthusiasm.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[38]</a></span>
‘You deserve the Victoria Cross, and a
commission, too. I’ll do my best to help
you to both.’</p>

<p>He was as good as his word. Before
the Duke’s Own left the Coast the <em>Gazette</em>
contained both announcements, and Herbert
Larkins was now ‘an officer and a
gentleman’ at last.</p>

<span class="fs70">MAKING THE AMENDE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">There was terrible grief at Farrington
Hall when the news came home of the
death of the son and heir. Poor silly Lady
Farrington was quite broken-hearted. Had
she had her way Ernest would never have
gone to the wars. Moreover the circumstances
under which he left made matters
infinitely worse. He was at home, as we
know, when the regiment got the route,
and the orders he received from the Horse
Guards were peremptory that he should rejoin
without a moment’s delay. The young
soldier was not over keen about obeying.
Life, in spite of family jars, had just then
a peculiar sweetness for him. He had established
Mimie in a pretty little villa at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">[40]</a></span>
Wimbledon, where he spent most of his
time. His visits to the Hall, and his stay
when he came, were much curtailed, greatly
to his mother’s sorrow. Her ladyship
knew of his ‘entanglement,’ but quite as
a secret, and she was discreetly silent on
the subject. She only upbraided her boy
for his constant absences.</p>

<p>‘I’th too bad, Ernetht. We thee tho
little of you now. You mutht come and
thettle down at home. Marry a nithe
wife&mdash;’</p>

<p>Which was meant as a gentle womanly
hint that she knew what occupied his
thoughts and his time.</p>

<p>Sir Rupert’s line towards Ernest was
more plainly marked, and possibly less judicious.
He very soon gave his son to
understand that he knew all about the
Gibraltar escapade.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">[41]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I thought it was only a passing act of
folly. Young men cannot always be trusted
to behave with judgment and decorum. It
is very deplorable, of course, but no more,
after all, than others have done. What I
complain of, Ernest, is that there appears
to be no end to your infatuation. I hear&mdash;no
matter how&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘From Mr. Oozenam, I presume,’ said
Ernest, bitterly. ‘I knew he was dogging
my footsteps, but did not think he had
been set on by my father. It’s a disgraceful
shame!’</p>

<p>‘I hear,’ went on Sir Rupert, speaking
still calmly, but the black look on his face
showed that he was fast growing furious,
‘that you are continually at a house at
Wimbledon, where, I suppose, this&mdash;this
person&mdash;resides.’</p>

<p>‘Look here, father, you are going too<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">[42]</a></span>
far,’ put in Ernest, hotly. ‘I am quite old
enough to&mdash;&mdash;.’</p>

<p>‘To make a fool of yourself? No doubt.
You always were that. You’ve been a fool
all your life. But you shall not make a
fool of me.’</p>

<p>‘I won’t stay another minute in the
house.’</p>

<p>‘If you leave it, you shall not return to
it until you have begged my pardon.’ Sir
Rupert was very angry, still he strove to
be calm. ‘Be careful, Ernest, how you
aggravate me. I am willing to make allowances
for your youth, but you shall not
disgrace your name. Promise me to give
up this affair at once and for ever, or, or&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I will do nothing of the kind. I will
not be treated as a child,’ cried Ernest, in
a loud voice.</p>

<p>‘Then take the consequences, sir,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">[43]</a></span>
shouted Sir Rupert, still louder. ‘Leave
my presence, sir; leave the room, sir;
leave the house, sir; and do not dare to
show yourself again, sir, till I ask you,
which will be never, never, sir, so help
me&mdash;&mdash;’</p>

<p>Ernest, with a white and rather scared
face, got up and quietly walked away.</p>

<p>His father and he never met again in
the flesh.</p>

<p>There were many efforts at reconciliation,
but all had fallen through. Ernest,
before leaving the Hall, had gone to his
mother to say good-bye, and there had been
a very painful scene. The poor woman
was torn by conflicting emotions. She was
passionately fond of her boy, and desperately
afraid of her fierce spouse. But her
maternal instincts carried the day, and she
braved her husband’s anger, seeking to win<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">[44]</a></span>
forgiveness for her son. She failed utterly.
The parties to the quarrel were equally determined,
but in different ways. Ernest
was weakly and foolishly obstinate; Sir
Rupert, harsh, implacable, unrelenting.
Father insisted upon submission unconditional
and complete; son refused even to
admit that he was wrong. Farrington
Hall was a sad house while the dispute was
in progress, and Lady Farrington was a
very unhappy woman. Then, while matters
were still unaccommodated, came the
orders for active service, and she was in a
paroxysm of despair. She made piteous
appeals to Sir Rupert; she wrote imploring
letters to her son, she besought the
Horse Guards to delay embarkation, and
pleaded all sorts of excuses to keep him at
home. But fate and the authorities were
inexorable, and Ernest, very much against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">[45]</a></span>
his own will too, was compelled to start for
the Coast.</p>

<p>He had never revisited the Hall. His
father would not ask him, and he would
not offer himself. His mother begged to
be allowed to go to Southampton to bid
him a last farewell, but Sir Rupert positively
forbade it; and Ernest left the country
with no one&mdash;except broken-hearted
Mimie&mdash;to bid him adieu.</p>

<p>This was why the news of his death
fell so heavily upon them all at home.
Lady Farrington broke down utterly. She
was like Rachel, and refused to be comforted.
Sir Rupert, although he was still
outwardly calm and impassive, felt it more
than he could say. But he showed his
grief very differently. It was a sort of
relief to him to burst forth into the loudest
invectives&mdash;not against himself, although<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">[46]</a></span>
his parental cruelty might well have caused
him the keenest remorse, but against all
who might, by the smallest implication, be
deemed to be responsible for Ernest’s untimely
end. Where was Diggle? Why
had he allowed the young fellow out of his
sight? And Sir Garnet, what excuse would
the general make for leaving a young officer
to be thus out-matched and massacred by
the rascally foe? He even included Mimie
Larkins in his reproaches, although she
manifestly was but little to blame. He
could not at first bring himself to think
well of Herbert, whose brave act in trying
to save his officer’s life was hailed with enthusiasm
in this country as soon as it became
known. What had this sergeant done?
Only his duty. It was the duty of every
sergeant or corporal in the service to lay
down his life for a Farrington, of course. And<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">[47]</a></span>
the young fellow had been amply rewarded&mdash;over
rewarded, if anything&mdash;for his pains.</p>

<p>But deeper down in Sir Rupert’s heart
there was anguish and sharp regret. As a
father he was deeply grieved at the loss of
an only son; but as the proud owner of an
old title and wide estates, it cut him to the
heart to think that he must be the last of
his line. Was it for this that he had schemed
and manœuvred? For this that he had caused
Lady Farrington to be placed under restraint&mdash;had
abandoned her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i> to
starve? Then followed a wave of better
feeling towards the gallant young fellow
who had heaped coals of fire on his head.
What a fine action it was! How splendidly
the young man had behaved! He half
wished that Herbert was really the heir to
the family honours, now that there was no
one else to inherit them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">[48]</a></span></p>

<p>Upon this point he would have met with
some sharp opposition within his family,
had he expressed his opinion. Much as
poor Ernest was regretted by all, there were
some who, after the first decorous mourning,
found themselves quite able to reconcile
themselves to his loss. To Mrs. Cavendish-Diggle,
Ernest’s death meant a certain
tangible gain. She could never succeed to
the baronetcy, certainly, but there were the
broad acres of Farrington which, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">faute de
mieux</i>, would now undoubtedly come to
her. Possibly, if Diggle did but take his
proper place in life, and could be persuaded
to enter Parliament, a grateful Government
might be brought to continue the baronetcy
through the female branch. Mrs. Cavendish
would have been only too pleased that
her infant son should some day resume the
name and arms of the Farrington family,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">[49]</a></span>
and that the Diggle-Farringtons should
become celebrated as the proprietors of
Farrington Hall. The son was forthcoming,
indeed more than one; but poor Cavendish-Diggle
was not himself quite equal to
the task which the ambitious Letitia would
have imposed upon him. The Gold Coast
campaign, in fact, had nearly cost him his
life, and had left him almost a wreck.
Weeks of low fever upon a miserable sickbed
in the malarious bush, had nearly
finished him; and long before the end of
the war he had returned to England more
dead than alive. His life in the long run
was spared, but the once smart dandy reappeared
a broken, half-crippled man, one
much more fitted to spend the remainder of
his days in European health resorts, drinking
the waters and taking the baths, than
in any active struggle for parliamentary or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[50]</a></span>
contested family honours. Before the return
of the Duke’s Own to England he had
retired upon half-pay, and took no further
part in regimental affairs.</p>

<p>Herbert’s glorification, however, when
he reached England duly came off, and this
without any protest on the part of Mrs.
Cavendish-Diggle. She did not know
really that he was, or had ever been, a competitor
for the family estates. Besides
which, when he arrived she and her husband
were at Aix; and however calmly she
may have accepted the sad news of Ernest’s
death, she could not openly be otherwise
than pleased at the honour done to the
man who had endeavoured to save her
brother’s life. Herbert, whether or no, was
invited at once to the Hall, whither he went,
not from any love for Sir Rupert, but
simply to see how the land lay, and whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">[51]</a></span>
he could help the poor old dowager, who
still languished in her asylum prison.</p>

<p>Yet it was with a certain strange excitement
that he entered the house which
might be, and which somehow he felt ought
to be his. The baronet received him most
courteously; poor Lady Farrington fell
upon his neck and wept torrents of tears;
he was shown into a gorgeous guest
chamber, a room all blue satin and silver,
such as he had never before seen in all his
life; and he was treated with the most profound
respect on every side.</p>

<p>Lady Farrington was not equal to appearing
at table, and he dined with Sir
Rupert <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>. His host questioned him
closely upon the events of the campaign.
Acutely painful as was one of its episodes
to the baronet, he yet seemed to ignore
this, and was only anxious to give his guest<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">[52]</a></span>
an opportunity of describing what he had
seen. Possibly he was anxious also to
keep off dangerous ground, and to avoid
inconvenient questions upon points on
which Herbert was, if anything, far more
closely concerned.</p>

<p>Here, however, he counted without his
host. The young soldier was by nature,
and still more by his recent rough and
ready training, little disposed to beat about
the bush. He had resolved upon coming
to Farrington Hall to ascertain what could
be done to release the old Lady Farrington
from durance. He had had already one or
two communications from ‘the Boy’ Hanlon,
none of which, however, gave him much
hope of effecting this without the assistance
of the baronet himself. The ‘Boy’ had not
seen much of the old lady. She was, of
course, upon the female side of the asylum.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">[53]</a></span>
But Hanlon was not to be baulked by any
restrictions of sex, and as the rules of the
establishment forbade him from attending
upon a female patient, he made it his business
to secure the co-operation of a female
attendant. The person who had especial
charge of Lady Farrington was a middle-aged
damsel, to whom the blandishments of
‘the Boy’ were by no means distasteful.
Through this impressionable daughter of
Eve, Hanlon had communicated frequently
with the old lady. He had told her of
Herbert’s progress; of the young man’s
advancement in the lower walks of the
military career; finally of the Ashanti
war, and Herbert’s undoubted success.
Had the doctor been within easy reach, he
might have ordered Lady Farrington the
usual cooling regimen, so excited did she
become. But she escaped observation, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">[54]</a></span>
under the advice of her attendant, and
indeed through her own native intelligence
she managed to preserve a calm exterior,
feeling sure that her Herbert would soon
appear to open wide her prison doors.</p>

<p>That he was most eager to do so was
evident from his conversation with Sir
Rupert that first night.</p>

<p>‘I shall be only too glad to meet your
wishes in any way,’ the baronet had said.
‘At the Horse Guards, perhaps, or with
Mr. Cardwell&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I will not ask so much,’ Herbert replied.
‘I have been already treated most
liberally by the authorities. All I want is&mdash;to
pay a visit to Greystoke.’</p>

<p>‘To Greystoke?’ Sir Rupert turned
rather pale.</p>

<p>‘Yes, and with you. You see I know
everything. Why hesitate, Sir Rupert?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">[55]</a></span>
There need be no concealment between us.
The last time we met I was a victim&mdash;one
of your victims&mdash;but now I am above all
that, but poor Lady Farrington still suffers.’</p>

<p>‘It would not be safe, I assure you, to
set her at large. I have that on the best
authority. She is still quite insane.’</p>

<p>‘I have it on better that she is now
perfectly recovered.’</p>

<p>‘May I ask who is your informant?’
Sir Rupert blandly enquired.</p>

<p>‘One of the attendants at the asylum.’</p>

<p>‘A skilled practitioner? A medical
man?’</p>

<p>‘Well, no; not exactly. He was, in
fact, formerly in the Duke’s Own.’</p>

<p>‘As a surgeon?’</p>

<p>‘No, in the ranks.’</p>

<p>‘And you would set up his opinion&mdash;the
opinion of an illiterate, untrained man&mdash;against<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">[56]</a></span>
that of the highest medical
authority in the country? Really, Mr.
Larkins&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘He’s an honest, straightforward man,
Sir Rupert, with plenty of common sense.
His judgment may be at fault, but at any
rate his opinion is certain to be unbiassed
and unprejudiced; he assures me that Lady
Farrington is perfectly fit to take care of
herself, and ought to be immediately set at
large.’</p>

<p>‘I cannot agree with your friend. I
have seen her only within these last few
days, and I think she is as bad as ever.’</p>

<p>‘I shall refer the matter, then, to one of
the Lord Chancellor’s visitors,’ said Herbert,
displaying an intimate acquaintance with
procedure which rather surprised Sir
Rupert.</p>

<p>‘That is not necessary, I assure you.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">[57]</a></span>
If the poor lady is capable of taking care of
herself I do not wish to detain her. Far
from it. If it is really your wish to visit
Greystoke, Mr. Larkins, we will go there
to-morrow.’</p>

<p>And thus Sir Rupert Farrington consented
to a step which could not but have
very serious consequences to himself and
all who were dependent upon him.</p>

<span class="fs70">VISITORS AT GREYSTOKE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Greystoke had once been a manor-house
and place of mark in the county of Hopshire.
A long-fronted but compact mansion,
with thick walls and a wide moat, it
still looked capable of withstanding a siege.
Not that there was any chance of one.
Admission was not difficult to obtain, provided
the usual formalities were observed.
The thing was to get out again when you
had once got in. The natural strength of
the place made it nearly as secure as a prison.
But no bolts or bars were needed; if
the stout doors and numerous gates, deep
moat, and broad haha had not sufficed,
there was behind all the lynx-eyed watchfulness
of the attendants.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">[59]</a></span></p>

<p>Joe Hanlon was in high favour at Greystoke.
In him&mdash;thanks to his long military
training&mdash;prompt unhesitating obedience
had come to be second nature. All orders
he received he carried out implicitly, and
to the letter. He was as plucky too as he
was punctual; and he could always be relied
on when there was an ugly job on
hand. Hard, tough, and resolute, he was
ready to tackle the most truculent patient,
and brave his fiercest rage. ‘The Boy’s’
little weakness for refreshment might have
done him harm at Greystoke, but his superiors
at the asylum were not as keen in the
detection of unsteadiness as the non-commissioned
officers of the Duke’s Own; and
when Joe was at all ‘on,’ he managed to
keep the secret to himself. Perhaps, as a
valuable servant, his masters were often
conveniently blind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">[60]</a></span></p>

<p>As a person of some authority, Hanlon
was at liberty to go where he pleased in
the establishment. One morning he paid
a visit to the female wing, and asked to see
Miss Ponting.</p>

<p>‘Good morning, Mr. Hanlon.’</p>

<p>‘Morning, Miss. How is she to-day?’
he went on at once, and with no little excitement
in his voice.</p>

<p>‘Her ladyship? Like a lamb. What’s
amiss, Mr. Hanlon? You look peeked.’</p>

<p>Miss Ponting’s duties had lain for some
years with the most aristocratic patients,
and she cultivated a refinement of language
and a fastidiousness of expression which
imposed upon no one so much as herself.
But for the firm lines of her mouth and
steady eye&mdash;traits which proved her fitness
for her present employment&mdash;she might
have been set down as a fat foolish woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[61]</a></span>
of forty, with the airs and graces of girlhood,
and the pretentiousness of one who
sought to be considered superior to her
station. She had a fine eye for the main
chance, however, and this had led her to
listen willingly enough to ‘the Boy’s’ blandishments.
There was profit, perhaps, substantial
and considerable, to be got out of
the affair.</p>

<p>‘They’re coming over this very day,’
cried Hanlon. ‘Sir Rupert and the captain’&mdash;Joe
had already given Herbert promotion,
partly out of affection, and partly
to impress Miss Ponting&mdash;‘and the whole
kit of ’em.’</p>

<p>‘Well, what puts you in such a taking?
We ain’t to be trampled upon like the sands
of the seashore. We’re ready for anyone
that chooses to come.’</p>

<p>‘But is <em>she</em>? The captain means to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[62]</a></span>
have her out, and so I tell you; and it’ll all
depend on how they find her. Is she fit to
be seen?’</p>

<p>‘Never was better. Her appetite’s
<em>combsar</em>, but her manner’s quite <em>degagy</em>,
and her temper <em>debonnair</em>.’</p>

<p>‘Will it do to prepare her? Won’t it
flurry her, as when you told her of the fight
on the Coast?’</p>

<p>‘Best break it to her judgematically,
and with&mdash;with&mdash;a composing draught.
I’ll tell her too to hold her tongue&mdash;she is
mindful of what I say, always&mdash;and answer
only when she’s spoken to; and if I
put her into a quiet dress, and keep my
eye on her, she’ll come through all right,
or call me Jenny Say Quoy.’</p>

<p>‘I’ll call you a brick, and a beauty, and
Mrs. Hanlon, or anything you please,’ said
‘the Boy,’ in high glee. ‘You’re quite a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[63]</a></span>
genius, Georgeyana, and I’ll fight the man
who says you ain’t.’</p>

<p>The visitors arrived punctually at eleven.
Dr. Fewster, the proprietor of the establishment,
who had been briefly apprised by
Sir Rupert, received them in state in his
drawing-room. He was a man of a not
uncommon type, but certain peculiar characteristics
were very strongly developed in him.
A superficial observer, after five minutes’
talk, would have thought him one of the
pleasantest men in the world. The moment
he met you, Dr. Fewster took possession of
you, and began to dose you with oil&mdash;not
that known in the profession as croton, cod-liver,
or castor&mdash;but the metaphorical oil
of compliment and flattery, very thinly disguised.
If he had not taken to lunacy, he
might have made a fortune in general practice,
so honeyed were his accents, and reassuring
his tone.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[64]</a></span></p>

<p>When Herbert was presented to him,
Dr. Fewster put out his hand, and said with
much feeling,</p>

<p>‘To shake hands with a hero is indeed
an honour for us who never leave our armchairs
at home. Let me tell you, Mr. Larkins,
such deeds as yours send a thrill
through the whole country, and we are
proud&mdash;proud to call you one of ourselves.’</p>

<p>All this time he held Herbert’s hand,
and was shaking it as though it was a bottle
of his own medicine, very much to Herbert’s
discomfort, who inwardly apostrophised
him as an ass, a humbug, and a
cad.</p>

<p>‘And you, Sir Rupert, how pained yet
how pleased you must have been to welcome
him home&mdash;to have thanked him for
his devotion. Ah! would, would to Heaven
it had been more successful&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[65]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Fewster turned away, overcome
with emotion, but Sir Rupert, who knew
his man, said abruptly,</p>

<p>‘We have come on business, doctor.’</p>

<p>‘So I understood from your letter, although
you did not exactly specify what.
It is not then merely to visit my establishment,
which by the bye I should be only
<em>too</em> happy to show, but&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘To see Lady Farrington.’</p>

<p>‘<em>In</em>deed! This gentleman is perhaps acquainted
with, possibly interested in, the case?’</p>

<p>‘This Mr. Larkins,’ said Sir Rupert, not
without bitterness, ‘is an old friend and
<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</span> of her ladyship’s. He has not seen
her for some years&mdash;in fact not since she
has been here.’</p>

<p>‘To be sure, to be sure, I remember
now,’ and the doctor looked at Herbert
with a keen, cunning glance, wondering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[66]</a></span>
whether there was anything to fear from
that quarter.</p>

<p>‘I have not yet been my rounds,’ he
said; ‘I cannot tell how her ladyship is
this morning; but if she is presentable&mdash;there
are times, you understand, when she
is not quite, quite self-possessed, you know,
and perhaps&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Mr. Larkins thinks that there may be
some mistake; that the poor lady is not
what you, Dr. Fewster, and what we all
imagine. He has heard that she is perfectly
quiet and rational.’</p>

<p>‘May I ask from whom?’</p>

<p>Herbert did not reply. He was too
much interested in the door, at which he
was looking steadily. He was perhaps expecting
some one.</p>

<p>‘Some one in the establishment,’ Sir
Rupert answered for him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">[67]</a></span></p>

<p>‘In my establishment? Can it be possible
that you would accept any evidence
but my own? I forbear to ask who your
informant may be’&mdash;in his own secret heart
he was registering a vow to discover, and
mentally promising the culprit a very short
shrift&mdash;‘but I need hardly say that information
surreptitiously obtained cannot always
be quite relied upon. Nor, may I
add, is any opinion of real value but that
of those duly accredited; and I must maintain
mine against all comers save and except
the great lights and authorities of my
own profession.’</p>

<p>At this moment a servant entered with
a card, which Dr. Fewster took up carelessly,
but as he looked at it his demeanour
suddenly changed.</p>

<p>‘Where is he?’ he hurriedly inquired of
the servant. ‘In my study? or has he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_68" id="Page_68">[68]</a></span>
gone into the building? Gentlemen, pray
forgive me, but this is a visitor whom I
cannot neglect. It is Dr. Darlington Mayne,
the eminent alienist, and as you, perhaps,
are aware, the newly-appointed Chancellor’s
visitor. You will follow me, I trust?’</p>

<p>Sir Rupert looked savagely interrogative
at Herbert, as though to inquire whether it
was by his agency that this great official
had appeared so opportunely upon the scene.</p>

<p>‘I thought it would be more satisfactory
to all parties,’ Herbert said, quite calmly.
‘A friend of mine is an intimate friend of
his, and Dr. Mayne is already in full possession
of all the facts of the case.’</p>

<p>‘The young fellow plays his game
closely,’ thought the doctor, as he left the
room.</p>

<p>‘The young villain has stolen a march
upon me,’ thought Sir Rupert, and so
Herbert evidently had.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">[69]</a></span></p>

<p>Dr. Fewster was a little nervous when
he met the great man, who, without waiting
for the proprietor, had gone at once into
Lady Farrington’s apartments, and was
already in close conversation with her.</p>

<p>‘Dr. Fewster? Ah! I wished to see her
ladyship,’ began Dr. Mayne, rather curtly.</p>

<p>‘Oh, of course. And how <em>are</em> you this
morning, my dear lady?’ inquired the asylum
doctor.</p>

<p>‘Very well; perfectly well, as I have
been these five years past,’ replied Lady
Farrington, with great coolness and self-possession.</p>

<p>The old lady had aged considerably
since we last saw her. Her hair was snow
white. There was a sort of rather mournful
expression in her dark eyes, which one sees
often in human beings and all who have
been long in captivity, and have but little<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">[70]</a></span>
hope of release. But these eyes had lost
none of their brilliancy, and she sat up
straight in her chair, with evident signs of
strength and vitality still unimpaired. The
great news which the attendant had communicated
to her but an hour or two before,
that Herbert was close by, and meant
to get her out, somehow, had put new life
into her.</p>

<p>‘Your ladyship slept well?’ went on
Dr. Fewster, ‘no visions, no visitors&mdash;from
Africa?’</p>

<p>Lady Farrington’s hands trembled, and
a sudden gleam flashed from her eyes,
but she saw Miss Ponting looking at her,
and instantly she subsided into perfect calm.</p>

<p>The reference to Herbert was artfully
made, but it failed.</p>

<p>‘I never see visions. You are talking
nonsense, Dr. Fewster.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">[71]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No apparitions? No ghostly messages
from missing and long-lost friends?’</p>

<p>Lady Farrington appeared a little agitated,
but again a glance from Miss Ponting
reassured her.</p>

<p>‘Of course not. I do not understand
you in the least.’</p>

<p>‘Nothing from Herbert Larkins? He
has given you no warning of his approaching
return?’</p>

<p>This was a great trial to her ladyship,
but she bore it wonderfully well. A greater
test was in store for her.</p>

<p>‘What if I tell you he is close at hand,
that within a week, within a day or two
perhaps, you may see him again?’</p>

<p>The poor lady’s fortitude for a moment
gave way:</p>

<p>‘You mean that he is here at this moment,
actually here in the house. Oh, let<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">[72]</a></span>
me see him! my sweet, sweet boy; now,
now, at once, I implore you&mdash;’</p>

<p>Then she stopped suddenly, but with a
manifest effort, and turning to Dr. Mayne,
said piteously,</p>

<p>‘It is not fair; it is cruel to work upon
my feelings thus. This is the subject nearest
to my heart, and he knows it, hoping to
excite me and make me appear other than
I am. It is for this dear boy that I am imprisoned
here&mdash;I will speak&mdash;’ (this was in
answer to a warning gesture from Miss
Ponting). ‘This gentleman is a Government
visitor, he has said so, come here on
purpose to do me justice. He shall hear
the whole story from beginning to end, and
he will know then that I have been the
victim of the hardest usage and foul
play.’</p>

<p>Dr. Fewster turned to Dr. Mayne with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">[73]</a></span>
a meaning look, which plainly implied that
he would now see the form taken by Lady
Farrington’s craze. This was her weak
point&mdash;her monomania, and her madness
would soon unmistakeably be betrayed.</p>

<p>‘You shall tell me the whole story, Lady
Farrington, but privately, and in your own
way. I wish to see her ladyship alone,
quite alone.’</p>

<p>Dr. Mayne spoke very quietly; he was
an undemonstrative man, of few words, but
his manner and tone were one of much determination
and authority.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Sir Rupert and Herbert, left
to themselves, had exchanged but little conversation.
The baronet was preoccupied,
and there was a black scowl on his face,
which boded ill for any whom his anger
could touch. Herbert was silent too. He
felt that he had thrown away the scabbard,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">[74]</a></span>
and was fighting Sir Rupert to the
death.</p>

<p>The moments dragged themselves slowly
on, till presently Dr. Fewster returned,
with many apologies.</p>

<p>‘I am truly grieved to have kept you
so long from the object of your visit. The
fact is, Dr. Darlington Mayne also wished
to see Lady Farrington, and he is at present
closeted with her. Till he chooses to end
the interview we cannot disturb him, of
course.’</p>

<p>It was quite an hour later when Dr.
Mayne joined them.</p>

<p>‘These are the poor lady’s friends,’ said
the asylum doctor, with much formality.
‘Sir Rupert Farrington, Mr. Herbert Larkins,
of the Duke’s Own.’</p>

<p>Dr. Mayne bowed very coldly to Sir
Rupert, but put out his hand to Herbert.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">[75]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Our mutual friend, Dr. McCosh, has
often spoken to me of you. That was a
noble deed of yours, and I am glad to know
you, Mr. Larkins.’</p>

<p>‘But Lady Farrington?’ eagerly interposed
Herbert, as soon as he civilly
could.</p>

<p>‘It is a case of some little difficulty. I
am really rather perplexed. Her ladyship
is perfectly sane, I think, and rational, except
on one point. If I could but obtain
some independent testimony on that, I
might see my way. She perseveres in
asseverating, although she can adduce
no proofs, that her son Herbert, whom
she has not seen for upwards of five and
twenty years, left a son, and that you, Mr.
Larkins, are he.’</p>

<p>Herbert replied slowly and with an air
of the deepest conviction,</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">[76]</a></span></p>

<p>‘She is perfectly right. I am.’</p>

<p>‘Great powers!’ cried Sir Rupert, starting
to his feet and foaming with rage.
‘Was there ever such matchless effrontery?’</p>

<p>‘It can be fully substantiated,’ went on
Herbert, still perfectly calm.</p>

<p>‘It is a gross and unfounded lie, from
beginning to end&mdash;a conspiracy, an attempt
to defraud.’</p>

<p>‘Of that the law can only judge,’ said
Dr. Mayne; ‘but I must confess Mr. Larkins’
assertion so far satisfies my mind
that I feel convinced Lady Farrington is
not suffering from any hallucination, and
I shall recommend her immediate discharge.’</p>

<p>‘You cannot, must not; my life would
be in peril,’ expostulated Sir Rupert, still
furious, but rather taken aback.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">[77]</a></span></p>

<p>‘My mind is quite made up,’ said the
Chancellor’s visitor, authoritatively.</p>

<p>‘And I give you notice,’ went on Herbert,
‘on behalf of Lady Farrington, that
Mr. Bellhouse, her solicitor, will forthwith
commence an action against you for illegal
detention, and will require a full account
of all moneys due to her during the time
she has been under restraint.’</p>

<p>‘I care nothing for your actions,’ cried
Sir Rupert, snapping his fingers, ‘and if I
spend my last shilling she shall not go at
large.’</p>

<p>But he was compelled to give way. The
law was too strong for him, his opponents
too full of fight. And that they meant
business was clear from an advertisement
which appeared everywhere directly after
Lady Farrington was set free. It was as
follows:&mdash;‘5,000<em>l.</em> Reward. To anyone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">[78]</a></span>
who will give authentic proofs of marriage
about 184&mdash; between Herbert Farrington,
<em>alias</em> Corporal Smith, of the 12th Lancers,
and Ann, daughter of Josiah Orde, of Newark-on-Trent.’</p>

<span class="fs70">A MOMENTOUS QUESTION.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">The Dowager Lady Farrington, after long
years of grief and sorrow, had chanced at
last upon happier days. Her cup of bliss
seemed filled now to overflowing. To be
free once more, released from the hateful
asylum, with its painful associations and
unbroken restraint, was in itself a great
joy; that Herbert was restored to her was
a yet greater delight, but greatest of all
was the knowledge that her heart had not
misled her, and that she had rightly recognised
him as the offspring of her own ill-used
and long-lost boy. Herbert had told
her the story as he had had it from Mrs.
Larkins, and the statement&mdash;although it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">[80]</a></span>
lacked formal legal proof&mdash;was more than
sufficient to satisfy her ladyship’s mind.
She was, indeed, only too eager to believe
it. But had any doubt remained, it would
have been more than removed, so she declared,
by the living Herbert’s extraordinary
resemblance to the one that was dead
and gone.</p>

<p>‘As I look at you now, a full-grown
man, I seem to see my own poor son once
more,’ cried the old lady, with tears of joy
in her eyes. ‘You have his face, his features,
all his ways. Even the colour of
your hair and of your eyes is the same.
You are a Farrington, every inch; I know
it, I feel it, and everybody else shall own it
also, and at once.’</p>

<p>Nothing would please her but that he
should assume, without loss of time, the
Farrington name and arms.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">[81]</a></span></p>

<p>‘No, not yet,’ he pleaded; ‘I am not
entitled to them.’</p>

<p>‘Are you not my grandson? Who shall
gainsay that?’</p>

<p>‘I know it, and I glory in it; but still
the case is not satisfactorily proved. Besides,
if I am to take the name of Farrington
at all, it can only be as the head of the
house.’</p>

<p>‘You <em>are</em> Sir Herbert Farrington, at
this very moment.’</p>

<p>‘I ought to be, perhaps. But you will
admit that to say so positively at present
would be quite premature. It would not
be in very good taste either, and I had
much rather let things stay as they are.’</p>

<p>To this Lady Farrington eventually assented,
but not with the best grace in the
world.</p>

<p>‘At any rate, everyone shall know that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">[82]</a></span>
I recognise and adopt you,’ she said, with
all a woman’s pertinacity. ‘You may be
called Mr. Larkins, but you are the son of
this house. All I have is yours, now if you
wish it, and absolutely so after I am gone.’</p>

<p>And to prove her words she sought, in
spite of his protestations, to load him with
rich gifts. Her ladyship happily had ample
funds at her disposal. Whatever sinister
motives may have actuated Sir Rupert in
locking her up, he had behaved with scrupulous
honesty towards her effects. As the
appointed administrator, he had full power
over every penny of hers, but he never
misappropriated one. No sooner was Lady
Farrington at large, than he rendered an
exact account of his stewardship to Mr.
Bellhouse, and the balance he handed over
was very satisfactory indeed. Out of this
Lady Farrington wished to make large<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[83]</a></span>
settlements at once upon Herbert, contenting
herself with her jointure, which would
amply suffice for all her needs as before.
But she attached a condition that he should
retire forthwith from the profession in
which he had first begun to climb, and
reside with her, devoting himself also to the
great emprise of fully establishing his claims.</p>

<p>It was a severe struggle for the young
man: On the one side, gratitude to the kind
benefactress who had done so much for him
impelled him to accept the offer she so
generously made; on the other, his affection
for the service in which he had already
begun to rise urged him as strongly to reject
the conditions she wished to impose.
At any rate, he begged for time. There
was no need to decide in a hurry. He had
still six months’ leave to run; something
might turn up to support his case&mdash;some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">[84]</a></span>
answers to the advertisement, some news of
the missing marriage lines. Lady Farrington
consented gladly enough. All she asked
was that he should remain always at her
side. This time was spent in London,
whither the pair had come immediately
after Lady Farrington’s discharge. Farrington
Court was hateful to her, she declared,
and for obvious reasons; it was too
near the Hall, too near the monster who had
cast a cloud over the last half-dozen years
of her life; too full of memories she desired
now to shut out for ever. London, with its
varied interests and amusements, its busy
life, and stirring ways, was more calculated
to suit Lady Farrington’s temper than a
semi-conventual seclusion in a lonely and
nearly empty country place. Mr. Bellhouse
had therefore secured a snug house
in a Mayfair street, a thoroughfare noisy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">[85]</a></span>
with carriages, gay and lively always with
people passing continually to and fro.
Here Miss Ponting had also been installed
as lady’s-maid, a very wise precaution, which
served to keep Lady Farrington always
quiet. ‘The Boy’ was also one of the household.
He had given himself his discharge
the day after the great scene at the asylum,
having done the business entrusted to him,
and wishing to avoid any altercation with
the angry and suspicious chief. Hanlon’s
position in Vaughan-street was not at first
quite clearly defined; but, beginning as
hall-porter, he lapsed first into general factotum,
and then into Herbert’s body-servant
and own particular man. His appointment
was rather a sinecure; beyond cleaning his
master’s boots, to which he gave a lustre
which was the envy of every shoeblack
whom Herbert passed in the streets, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[86]</a></span>
pipeclaying his kid gloves, for want of anything
better on which to try his hand, he
had not the slightest idea of the duties of
a valet; and Herbert had as little knowledge
of what he should ask Hanlon to do.
But the two talked constantly together of
old times; they compared notes of past
experiences, discussed old comrades, cross-questioned
each other, and wound up by
expressing their unbounded and unshaken
opinion that there never was and never
would be such a corps in any army in the
civilised world as the Duke’s Own. When
they came to this point Herbert’s heart grew
heavy, and he sought to change the conversation.
‘The Boy,’ after a little, saw this.</p>

<p>‘Faith, sir’&mdash;he was most religiously
respectful nowadays&mdash;‘you jib and shirk
whenever we come to talk of the old corps.
You’re as bad as the colonel when a Goojerat<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[87]</a></span>
day came twice in the same week. What’s
up, sir? You’re not going to turn your
back upon the old corps?’</p>

<p>‘That’s just where it is, Joe. Lady
Farrington wants me to retire and live
always with her.’</p>

<p>‘And you that’s only just got your commission,
sir, and that’ll be adjutant when
you please, and a staff officer, and a field
officer, and a general officer, and all sorts
of officers rolled into one, before you be got
a grey hair. G’long with you, sir! It’s
the wildest, maddest&mdash;well, no, that’s not a
pleasant word to use in this house. But
you mustn’t do it, sir; you mustn’t do it.
Only this blessed day did I see the captain&mdash;Greathed&mdash;him
that’s colonel now, you
know; and he axes after you; and sez he,
is he pretty stout? sez he; and sez I, he is
that, sez I; and I’ll be coming to see him,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">[88]</a></span>
sez he; and I hope he will, this very day,
sez I, for it’s a folly to talk to him, sez I;
which it is, sez he; I mean, sez I&mdash;but I’m
fairly bothered, like Johnny Raw at recruits’
drill.’</p>

<p>There was no doubt that Herbert,
although he fought against it, was chafing
much at his present life. If it was to be all
like this he would willingly, in preference,
return to ‘sentry-go.’ Lady Farrington’s
kindness was great and unceasing of course.
She never tired of expressing her affection,
and this in something more substantial than
mere words. He had <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">carte blanche</i> at the
best tailor’s, a park hack, and as much
money as he could spend. For a time all
this was pleasant enough. It was his first
experience of London; and no young man
in funds is likely to find London dull. But
it is possible to exhaust its amusements<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">[89]</a></span>
after a time, especially when one has no
special pursuits and no hankering after
shady places and not too reputable ways.
There was no vice in Herbert, although he
was by no means a milksop or a prig. But
he knew too well what was due to himself
to lapse into the inanities which prove so
often irresistible to other young men. It
did not satisfy him to bet, and haunt the
theatres, and loaf about the Burlington
Arcade. Other and more rational ways of
employing his time he certainly found in
visiting exhibitions, seeing the sights, and
more especially in frequenting the United
Service Institution, where he devoted himself
for several hours of every day to the
continued study of the profession he was
doomed probably, and unhappily for him,
soon to leave. Often enough too he satisfied
his military cravings by attending the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">[90]</a></span>
Guard mounting at St. James’s Palace; he
was weak enough sometimes to accompany
a volunteer regiment on its way to the park
for drill, keeping step almost intuitively,
and enjoying the whole thing far more than
anyone in the crowd.</p>

<p>But all these did not half suffice to exhaust
his native energy, developed and increased
as it had been by his recent active
life. He panted continually for more to do.
He grew more and more hipped and out of
joint. He was so lonely too. Under the
peculiar circumstances of his early career it
was little likely that he would have many
acquaintances of his own age. He might
perhaps hunt up a few of his old Deadham
school friends, but school friends in after
life do not run up against each other much,
unless they have been at Eton, Harrow, or
the like, and belong of right to the great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">[91]</a></span>
world. He had no club as yet; no military
comrades even. He had so recently passed
across the great gulf which divides the commissioned
officer from the rank and file,
that he had not been accepted by the one,
although he had left the other altogether
behind.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, he kept his own counsel,
and would not for the world betray to
Lady Farrington that he was not perfectly
contented with his lot. It would have been
but a poor requital for all her kindness, he
said, and he must put the best face upon
the matter. Even that greater and far
keener trial, which was daily growing closer
and closer, when he would have to cut himself
finally adrift from his much-loved profession,
he would have faced, as he had
met other really greater trials, like a man.</p>

<p>But he was spared this, mainly through<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">[92]</a></span>
Colonel Greathed, and indirectly, also,
through ‘the Boy.’ The first came without
delay to see Herbert, but it was the latter
who had induced him to come. Naturally,
he was introduced to Lady Farrington, who
welcomed him very cordially as one of
Herbert’s early patrons and friends.</p>

<p>‘It has been a rough experience for my
grandson,’ said the old lady, who always
spoke of Herbert openly as a relation, ‘but
it will, no doubt, have been for his good.
At any rate, it is over now, and Herbert
will live like a gentleman for the rest of his
life.’</p>

<p>‘An <em>officer</em> and a gentleman, I trust,’
said Colonel Greathed, laying some stress
on the first word.</p>

<p>‘No, not exactly; he has promised me
that he will leave the service at once.’</p>

<p>‘He will be taken up and shot as a deserter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">[93]</a></span>
the very next day,’ said the colonel
with mock seriousness.</p>

<p>But the old lady took the statement <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">au
pied de la lettre</i>.</p>

<p>‘You don’t really mean that?’ she
asked, nervously.</p>

<p>‘Of course not,’ put in Herbert.</p>

<p>‘I mean that he is, and must always be,
a soldier&mdash;at heart. It’s in him, part of his
nature, and he can’t put it off like a slipper
or a coat.’</p>

<p>Lady Farrington looked hard at the
colonel, as if to grasp his meaning more
thoroughly, then turned her eyes interrogatively
upon Herbert.</p>

<p>‘You have never said a word of this,
Herbert, my sweet boy. You have expressed
no regrets, have offered no objections&mdash;?’</p>

<p>Herbert hung his head rather, and hesitated
to speak.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_94" id="Page_94">[94]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Can it be possible that I have prayed
you to take a step which is distasteful to
you? Selfish old wretch that I am!’</p>

<p>‘No, no, grandmother, it is not so. I
would do this and far more to gratify your
slightest wish. I will leave the service
gladly; I don’t care to remain in it, I don’t
indeed.’</p>

<p>‘Herbert, I cannot quite trust to what
you say. I shall ask Colonel Greathed to
tell me the exact truth. Will you leave us
alone together, and come back in half an
hour?’</p>

<p>Her ladyship pressed the colonel very
closely. She begged him to speak openly
and without reserve. In order to invite
confidence, she detailed the whole of the
circumstances connected with Herbert’s
birth and parentage. She enlarged upon
his possible prospects, and the importance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[95]</a></span>
of his always being at home to advance
them. What she scarcely referred to, brave
old soul! was the pleasure she would derive
from his constant companionship.</p>

<p>‘If you ask my advice, Lady Farrington,’
said Colonel Greathed, ‘I should say
leave him to follow his profession. It will
be no hindrance to him in prosecuting his
claims; and should these fail, as I apprehend
is just possible, he may nevertheless
achieve an excellent position for himself.
His bent is so strongly marked; he is so
promising a young soldier; he has already
done so well; he is, I firmly believe, so
keen and eager to continue in his career that
I think it would be unfair to himself, to his
friends, to the country he serves, to baulk
him and turn him aside.’</p>

<p>Lady Farrington was much moved.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[96]</a></span>
Her eyes were full of tears, and she could
hardly speak.</p>

<p>‘It will pain you, I fear, to part with
him. You will miss him greatly, I have
no doubt. Still such partings are only
short-lived, and when they are for a young
man’s good&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘You are right, Colonel Greathed, and
I am half ashamed of myself for my selfish
weakness, but I can hold out no longer.’</p>

<p>She wiped her eyes and sent for Herbert.</p>

<p>‘It is settled, and in the way to please
you best, I feel sure. You shall continue
in the calling you have chosen, my brave
boy. It must and shall be so. I have not
many years to live, but I pray God will
spare me until I see you righted I hope,
but at any rate on the high road to fame.’</p>

<p>She kissed him tenderly on the forehead,
as if to sign the agreement thus.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">[97]</a></span></p>

<p>‘But you will not leave me just yet,’
she said, almost piteously. ‘He need not
go back to the regiment directly, Colonel
Greathed?’</p>

<p>‘Certainly not; not till October, when
we embark for Gibraltar again. I shall
want him to take the adjutancy then.’</p>

<span class="fs70">BACK ON THE ROCK.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">As October approached, and with it the
time for rejoining his regiment, Herbert
became more and more eager and excited.
He was quite angry with himself for being
so pleased. It seemed such base ingratitude
to Lady Farrington to be so delighted
to leave her. But he was not that in the
least. He felt an increasing regard for her
which promised to develop some day into
deep affection. He was only overjoyed at
the prospect of once more resuming his
work. Those who have been long in regular
harness can best realize how flat, stale,
and unprofitable is life without a fixed
object and employment, more or less constant,
from morning till night. Neither by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">[99]</a></span>
inclination nor by his recent training was
Herbert of the sort to eat the bread of
idleness, or be satisfied with having nothing
to do. Therefore it was, that when his
adieux were made, and the poor old lady
left to her solitary grief, Herbert returned
to soldiering with all the vigour and elasticity
of a steel spring, which has been set
free. He could never forget all he owed
his first patron and firm friend; he meant
to spend a certain portion of his time with
her still; he would go to her always gladly
and with the utmost alacrity, when she expressed
a wish to see him or desired to
have him at her side. But in spite of all,
he was like a schoolboy just released from
school. The expiration of his leave and his
return to duty, which is to some officers
such an inexpressible bore, was to him a
source of the most unfeigned delight.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[100]</a></span></p>

<p>Yet it was not without a certain trepidation
that he prepared to take up his new
position. How would his brother officers
receive him? Would they accept him as
one of themselves? He remembered, certainly,
that when the news of his promotion
first reached the Coast, all had congratulated
him warmly, and made many cordial
and civil speeches, declaring him to
be an honour to the Duke’s Own. But
these were days of abnormal excitement;
a sharp campaign was barely ended, and
active service does much to sweep away
formality and level class distinctions. It
would be different now, perhaps, at an expensive
and brilliant mess in a gay garrison
town, where social life was always bubbling
up and boiling over in festive gatherings,
race-meetings, days with the Calpe hounds,
theatricals, and balls. Herbert had no particular<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">[101]</a></span>
craving for these joys. But would
he be freely admitted and readily welcomed
everywhere? Might not some, unmindful of
the fact that he had a gentleman’s education,
and that possibly his birth, if he got his
rights, was better than theirs, be disposed
to look down upon him, and despise him as
a man who had ‘risen from the ranks?’</p>

<p>Herbert was little acquainted with the
tempers and idiosyncrasies of British officers.
Although long associated with them,
it had been only as an inferior separated
from them by a wide gulf, and he saw only
what was on the surface: <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">brusquerie</i>, often,
an arrogant manner and a self-satisfied air.
He did not know that at bottom they were
honest and well-meaning fellows full of prejudices&mdash;not
all Newtons perhaps, or John
Stuart Mills&mdash;but straightforward honourable
men, who were in the habit of taking<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">[102]</a></span>
their comrades just as they found them, and
just for what they were worth. There may
be snobs who <ins class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;Original text: 'will kotoo to'">will kotow to</ins> a duke’s son, or
revolve as satellites round a wealthy young
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</i>; but the general verdict of a British
mess upon the individuals who compose
it, is based always upon their intrinsic
qualities and personal claims.</p>

<p>The Duke’s Own were not long in finding
out that Herbert Larkins was ‘a man
of the right sort,’ ‘a thorough good chap all
round.’ They saw, not without surprise,
perhaps, that he took his place among them
quite naturally, almost as though to the
manner born.</p>

<p>He behaved quite properly at the dinner-table;
he did not eat peas with a knife,
or drink with his mouth full; he could
take his share in the conversation&mdash;never
very abstruse or wide in its range&mdash;and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[103]</a></span>
that without dropping his h’s or miscalling
his words. He could do most things, too;
play cricket and racquets, shoot, ride or
play a rubber of whist. Above all, he had
a pleasant face and a genial manner, with a
smile and a civil word for all who spoke to
him, whether on duty or off.</p>

<p>This last was almost sufficient recommendation
in itself, especially when found
in the adjutant, as it was in Herbert’s case.
Colonel Greathed was not a commanding
officer to be led by the nose; he drove his
own coach, and had his team always well in
hand. But even under his <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">régime</i> the adjutant
was as he must always be&mdash;a considerable
personage. He really wields much
power; he is the usual channel of communication
with the colonel; through him officers
apply for leave or other indulgences;
he keeps the duty roster, and can, if he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[104]</a></span>
pleases, do even the oldest a good turn, by
carrying out exchanges, and substituting one
name for another, even at the eleventh hour.
Over the prisoners he exercises the sway of
a task-master and pedagogue combined;
he can prolong drill-instruction to a maddening
length; and upon his good or evil
report much of their happiness depends.
With the non-commissioned officers, and
rank and file, the adjutant is generally an
irresponsible autocrat and king. He holds
the sergeants in the hollow of his hand; the
colonel nearly always relies upon him to
recommend men for promotion, and it is he
who brings forward deserving private soldiers
and raises them out of the ruck. All
this tends to make his position dangerously
full of snares. He may easily become
puffed up and conceited; worse still (and
this is especially noticeable in adjutants<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">[105]</a></span>
who have risen from the ranks), he may
drift into favouritism; and, by reason of
his intimate acquaintance with the ins and
outs of military life, fall into the error
of knowing too much and seeing too much.
That Herbert steered clear of all the hidden
rocks which threaten the adjutant’s course
was the best testimony to his worth. Although
he never swerved from his duty, no
adjutant could have been more generally
popular.</p>

<p>The days passed evenly and pleasantly
enough. They were happy days for Herbert,
which he remembered always in his
after life. Busy days, beginning with the
fresh morning hours, when he took the battalion
out for early drill, and ending with
the inspection of the non-commissioned officers
at tattoo. Guard-mounting parade in
a fortress bristling with sentries; orderly-room<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[106]</a></span>
in a place where liquor, unfortunately,
is cheap; much correspondence and many
intricate returns, in a garrison fully provided
with the regulation number of staff
officers, all these kept him close till it was
long past mid-day. Then there was afternoon
parade, more writing, the drill of
young officers, and a few recruits, or awkward
squads, and the day was well advanced
before he could call himself really free; but
there were few days when he did not find
time for a smart canter along the beach of
Gibraltar Bay, the Rotten Row of the Rock,
or for a longer ramble upon the slopes below
the Queen of Spain’s Chair, or on the
San Roque road and towards the Cork Wood.
Now and again, but rarely, and chiefly
when the meet was near at hand, he gave
himself a half-holiday, and spent many enjoyable
hours with the Calpe hounds. It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">[107]</a></span>
was his first taste of hunting, and although
not quite of the best, perhaps, it was a
pleasant introduction to the mysteries of
sport. There was always the fair landscape
lying bright under the southern sky; the
change and movement through the fresh,
sweet-scented air, the cheerful companionship
of a field of happily-disposed people,
whom the day’s outing, with its short runs
and rapid break-neck gallops, thoroughly
amused.</p>

<p>Ladies, not many certainly, but all very
ardent followers of the chase, invariably
attend the meets of the Calpe hounds.
Herbert saw them, each with her little
band of devoted attendants, for ladies are
scarce at Gibraltar, and all who have the
smallest pretensions to please can always
count upon a court of their own. Herbert
owed allegiance to none of the reigning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[108]</a></span>
queens; he had no leisure for flirting
and philandering, nor did he much enjoy
the garden-party, afternoon tea, or small
and early dance. When he was out with
the hounds, therefore, he ranged about
alone or with some male companion of his
own sort. He had hardly a bowing acquaintance
with any one of the fair sex
upon the Rock, and it was with no little
surprise that he found himself one day
greeted with a nod and a most friendly
smile by one whom, for the moment, he
did not seem to know.</p>

<p>It was Miss Prioleau.</p>

<p>The general, with his wife and daughter,
had been away, on leave in England,
when the Duke’s Own returned to Gibraltar.
They had only been back a few days
when Herbert thus again encountered his
little friend Edith for the first time.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[109]</a></span></p>

<p>He raised his hat, and would have ridden
on, but the general himself came up
with outstretched hand:</p>

<p>‘Allow me, Mr. Larkins, to congratulate
you. As one of the old regiment, I
take a pride in any one who has contributed
to its credit. You have done so, and
right well. I am glad to think you have
met with your deserts.’</p>

<p>‘Yes, indeed,’ put in the sweet voice
of the daughter, and somehow the simple
words were far more grateful to Herbert’s
ears than the sonorous praises which fell
from her father’s lips. ‘Yes, indeed, Mr.
Larkins, it was a noble action, and we are
all proud of it.’</p>

<p>The bright maiden had now grown into
the fair and more staid and self-conscious,
but winsome girl. Yet she was the same
attractive little person, no less engaging,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[110]</a></span>
and far more dangerous now in her budding
womanly beauty than when he had
seen her last, still almost a child in her
white habit, patronising him at the general’s
inspection, and, metaphorically, patting
him on the back.</p>

<p>Herbert muttered a few words in acknowledgment
of the general’s courteous
approval. Edith he thanked by a grateful
look, which had perhaps more meaning in
it than he intended, or that she exactly
liked.</p>

<p>‘I do believe they have found, father!’
she cried; and as she spoke there was a
sudden stir and bustle at the far end of the
field. Next moment came the whimper of
a hound; then the cheering voice of the
huntsman, then the twang of a horn, then
a whole chorus of voices&mdash;for out here
everyone acted as amateur whip and unprofessional<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[111]</a></span>
aid&mdash;swelling up into a grand
volume of sound.</p>

<p>‘Yoicks! For’rad! Ga&mdash;wn a&mdash;way!’</p>

<p>It promised to be a capital burst. They
had been drawing the White House covert,
and the fox headed for the Majarambu
woods. The country was rough; now and
again you came to a precipice like the side
of a house; next to a long slope studded,
as it might be, with the great boulders of
an old world glacier or moraine; then
broad uplands clothed with broad tufts of
the gum cistus, just high enough to oblige
your horse to take them in a series of quick
jumps not always very easy to sit. The
pace was good, the going difficult, and, an
unusual thing, the run was protracted for
more than a quarter of an hour. Ere long
the field began to tail off, and presently
there were very few people in the first<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[112]</a></span>
flight. Bill Ackroyd, the huntsman, was
one, so was the M.F.H., Herbert also, and
Edith Prioleau, but without her papa. The
general had got into difficulties at a wide
drain, where, as some irreverent subalterns
remarked, it was to be hoped he might
stay, at least beyond the following Saturday,
so that they might escape the usual
weekly field-day upon the North Front.</p>

<p>In the exuberant enjoyment of galloping
at top speed over a break-neck country,
Edith had all but forgotten the existence
of her father. No doubt he would turn up
at the first check. Runs were not so plentiful,
and this one was far too good to lose.
She meant to see it out to the very last.</p>

<p>Not quite. There must be accidents
sometimes, as the Spanish journals say
when describing bull-fights; and all at once
Edith’s horse, a not too surefooted barb,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[113]</a></span>
put his foot in a hole, and he and his rider
came down together.</p>

<p>Over and over they rolled, on the top
and close to the margin of the steep cliff, a
mixed-up mass, as it seemed to Herbert’s
terrified eyes, of habit, light curls, black
hoofs, gray mane, and tail. Quick as lightning
he had dismounted and gone to the
rescue. How he managed he never remembered;
but by a great effort, and, as he
thought, after the lapse of nearly an age
of time, he succeeded in disengaging Miss
Prioleau from her horse.</p>

<p>She had fainted. Her face was blanched
quite white; a small stream of crimson was
trickling from one temple as though she
had received a mortal hurt. To bring
water in his hunting-hat from a spring hard
by, to sprinkle her brow and chafe her
hands, was all that Herbert could do until<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">[114]</a></span>
the arrival of a number of others, among
whom were one or two eager but officious
ladies, and the affrighted general. To them
he resigned his charge, but he waited
anxiously a little way off to hear how it
fared with the poor girl.</p>

<p>Happily she soon came to. The shock
of her fall had deprived her of consciousness;
a small stone had hit her forehead;
but these were the worst injuries she had
endured. Very soon she was able to remount
her horse and ride slowly home.</p>

<p>Herbert felt first a little neglected, although,
as he told himself, he had really
no reason to expect any extravagant thanks.
Probably no one knew that it was he who
had extricated Miss Prioleau from her
perilous predicament, the general and his
daughter least of all, and what did it matter
if they did? The service was a very trifling<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">[115]</a></span>
one, after all, and he had only done what
any other man would have done in his
place.</p>

<p>He was quite wrong, however, in supposing
that those whom he had served were
ungrateful. Next morning came a formal
but most courteously-worded letter of
thanks from the general, and with it a
letter from Mrs. Prioleau, repeating her
husband’s phrases, and winding up with a
very friendly invitation to dine at an early
day.</p>

<p>Herbert gladly accepted, full of joy at
the prospect of meeting Miss Prioleau
again. He hardly considered how far the
acquaintance, if allowed to ripen, was likely
to affect his peace of mind.</p>

<span class="fs70">THE COURSE OF TRUE LOVE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">To the young military officer in whom the
reverential spirit is not entirely quenched,
the British general is often a very awful
person indeed. A halo of professional glory
surrounds the great man; strange powers&mdash;particularly
as to leave&mdash;are vested in him;
his frequent frown is terrific, his occasional
smile fails to reassure. To the officer
whose early days were spent in the ranks,
and who has never seen the general behind
the scenes, so to speak, as an English gentleman
no better than others of his class,
the formidable effect is intensified, and a
great gulf seems to separate the two.</p>

<p>It was with a shy feeling and rather a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[117]</a></span>
sinking heart that Herbert presented himself
at Line Wall House, the residence of
the major-general commanding; but he
found himself among friends even on the
threshold. An orderly sergeant, one of the
Duke’s Own, of course, and a former comrade,
took his coat and forage cap; and the
servant who ushered him into the drawing-room
was also an old soldier of the regiment
disguised in livery, who seemed to be
the herald of a triumphal procession as he
threw wide the doors and with stentorian
lungs announced</p>

<p>‘<em>Misther Larkins!</em>’</p>

<p>The friendliness was not, however, confined
to the attendants. The general’s
manner was most frank and kindly as he
came forward and shook hands. Mrs. Prioleau,
a well-meaning, but very languid
washed-out personage, also greeted him<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">[118]</a></span>
quite warmly, for her: while Edith received
him with such bright eyes and heightened
colour, conveying thanks and welcome all
in one, that, for the moment, he felt quite
overcome.</p>

<p>It was a small party of eight, carefully
chosen, probably with the idea of making
Herbert thoroughly at home. Another
subaltern like himself, but newly married,
with a pretty girlish cipher of a wife, and a
staff-surgeon, who proved to be Herbert’s
Ashanti friend, M‘Cosh. The general’s
aide-de-camp, Captain Mountcharles, a relation
of the family, made up the number.</p>

<p>Edith fell to Herbert on going in to
dinner. On her other side at the table was
the aide-de-camp, who, according to custom,
took the bottom, the general being at
the other end, and Mrs. Prioleau in the
centre on the right.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">[119]</a></span></p>

<p>The talk at dinner was not particularly
lively at first. Mrs. Prioleau never contributed
much; the general was really a
little shy himself, especially with people
whom he did not know intimately; Edith
was rather silent, and the rest of the company
seemingly abashed, all but one. The
exception was Captain Mountcharles, whose
duty it was, no less than his inclination, to
make himself agreeable, and he acquitted
himself very well of his task.</p>

<p>He was a very self-satisfied young gentleman,
rather disposed to be overdressed
and with a somewhat supercilious air. The
first showed itself in the splendour of his
shirt-front, with its single stud as large as
a cheese-plate, in his enormous shirt cuffs,
which he ‘shot out’ with a little concerted
cough just before he made a new remark,
in the breadth of his black satin tie, and in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">[120]</a></span>
the size of his watch chain, which had it
been long enough would have made a cable
for a seventy-four. The latter was to be
seen in his drawling accents and his tendency
to depreciate everybody and everything.</p>

<p>Herbert hated him almost instinctively
from the first, but his dislike was deepened
by his seeming familiarity with Edith,
whom he called by her Christian name.
She was his cousin, so it was all right
enough, but it jarred on Herbert all the
same.</p>

<p>‘Very poor sport to-day,’ said the aide-de-camp
to the general, ‘you did not miss
much, sir. You weren’t out, M‘Cosh?
Were you, Mr. Larkins&mdash;?’ punctiliously
polite to Herbert, as to an inferior; another
reason for hatred. ‘How anyone can hunt
here after the shires!’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[121]</a></span></p>

<p>‘<em>You</em> never hunted in the shires, Gaston,
so come,’ said downright Edith.</p>

<p>‘I beg your pardon, <em>Miss</em> Edith. I did,
several seasons while you were still at
school.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Prioleau never went to school, I
think,’ put in Herbert, and she turned on
him with a bright smile.</p>

<p>‘O, <em>do</em> you remember that day! I
never was so bothered, I think. French is
certainly the most difficult and detestable
of tongues.’</p>

<p>‘So I always thought,’ Herbert said.</p>

<p>‘You speak French, Mr. Larkins?’
asked the aide-de-camp, rather impertinently.</p>

<p>‘After a fashion, that of Deadham school.
Pray do you?’</p>

<p>‘Were <em>you</em> at Deadham?’ went on Captain
Mountcharles, rather shirking the question,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[122]</a></span>
and seeming to imply that a man who
had been in the ranks had no right to any
education at all.</p>

<p>‘Ye were at more schools than that, I
take it, Larkins,’ said Dr. M‘Cosh; ‘I saw
you in one, and a hot ’un, where you were
the head and dux of the class.’</p>

<p>‘You were at school together, then?’
Mrs. Prioleau asked civilly, but she was
evidently too apathetic to care about the
reply.</p>

<p>‘We played together, Mrs. Prioleau,
not with hoop or ball, or peg tops, but at
the great game of war.’</p>

<p>‘Ashanti, I presume,’ the general
said.</p>

<p>‘The idea of calling that a war, sir,’
interposed our bumptious A.D.C. ‘A picnic
would be a better name.’</p>

<p>‘It was not a picnic under the usual<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[123]</a></span>
circumstances, at any rate,’ Herbert said
quietly, as one entitled to speak.</p>

<p>‘No foiegras and hothouse grapes, perhaps,’
went on Mountcharles; ‘but you
must admit that the whole thing was monstrously
exaggerated.’</p>

<p>‘O, how <em>can</em> you say so?’ cried Edith,
quite eagerly.</p>

<p>‘And the honours, too, look how they
were overdone. Why there were more rewards
than for Waterloo.’</p>

<p>‘Some of them were richly deserved;
one in particular, which I could mention,’
replied Edith, with the air of a champion
defending the right.</p>

<p>‘It isn’t everyone who gets the chance
to deserve them,’ said Mountcharles, rather
sulkily. He had never seen a shot fired
himself, and bore malice in his heart to all
who had had better luck.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[124]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Or who would make the most of
it if they had,’ Edith retorted sharply, adding
in a low voice, ‘Gaston, I quite hate
you to-night: how disagreeable you <em>can</em>
be.’</p>

<p>For the remainder of the evening she
made him conscious of her high displeasure.
Mountcharles and she had hitherto been
the most excellent friends. An aide-de-camp
may be, and Mountcharles certainly
was, the very tamest of cats. He had other
claims besides those of cousinship to be
well received. With an only daughter,
young, lively, and exceedingly attractive,
both the general and Mrs. Prioleau had realised
the inconvenience and possible danger
of having a man continually about the
house, unless he were in every way an eligible
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i>. Edith had plenty of time before
her, no doubt, but at her age girls are<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[125]</a></span>
impressionable and very apt to succumb to
the first comer if he has many opportunities
of being at her side. Mountcharles had
been specially selected as A.D.C. by Mrs.
Prioleau, who, in spite of her languid
airs, was a shrewd, far-seeing woman, and
she felt that if anything were to happen, at
least they were safe with Gaston Mountcharles.
His father was dead, and he had
an excellent competence of his own. He
was a man of good birth, thoroughly presentable
in every way. Edith, if she could
only like him, might do very much worse.</p>

<p>But this night it was clear Edith did
not like him at all. Not that Mountcharles
much cared. He had probably far too good
an opinion of himself to be cast down by
the snubbings of a girl still in her teens.
Whether or no he took her treatment of
him very much to heart does not, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">[126]</a></span>
concern my readers so much as her behaviour
to the hero of my story.</p>

<p>To Herbert Larkins that evening she
was gracious and engaging in the extreme.
She made him talk to her on subjects he
would probably know best. She listened
to him with that close attention which is
in itself a subtle compliment, particularly
when coming from an attractive girl, and
she smiled her approval in that frank,
straightforward way which might be interpreted
one way, but which in her, perhaps,
meant nothing at all.</p>

<p>The effect upon Herbert was marked
and almost instantaneous. He was in truth
little accustomed to the fascinations of the
fair sex. He had never been brought up
to flirt and philander, to roam from flower
to flower, inhaling fragrance and passing
gaily on, and he fell at once deeply and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">[127]</a></span>
desperately in love. His heart went out at
once to the general’s daughter, without for
a moment considering whether his passion
was likely to be returned.</p>

<p>It was not, perhaps, exactly wise. A
man more versed in the ways of the world
would have been a little more cautious and
circumspect. Edith Prioleau counted her
swains by the score. Young ladies with
the great gift of beauty, of good birth, and
not without brains, pleasant talkers, good
dancers, forward riders, are not too common
in English society on the Rock. Among
the few belles of the place, Edith Prioleau
easily carried off the palm, and she had
always a crowd of admirers about her. She
did not resent or reject their attentions; on
the contrary, she honoured them all with
her favour in turn, and enjoyed it amazingly,
feeling, no doubt, that they meant nothing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">[128]</a></span>
any more than she did, and that, therefore,
she did no particular harm. Young soldiers
are reputed susceptible; but it is also
true that, if knocked over and quite hopeless
one day, they are generally quite heart-whole
the next.</p>

<p>Herbert Larkins was not a man of this
sort. He was in sober serious earnest
from the first. He was like a slave, grovelling
at her feet. She might trample on
him and spurn him if she pleased, but he
was hers always, whether she would have
him or no. The worst of it was that he
could not hide his feelings. He was too
honest&mdash;he had not enough of what the
world calls <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">savoir faire</i>. What did he care
who knew? He was not ashamed of his
weakness. It was not a passing fancy, but
a strong attachment; a deep-seated affection
which would last as long as he lived. Everybody<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[129]</a></span>
saw it: his brother-officers, like good
comrades, realising how much his heart was
in it, forebore to chaff him and take
him to task; the garrison generally, and
all smiled, or winked knowingly when
he was observed dancing attendance on
Edith, looking the picture of misery unless
she threw him a word. Captain Mountcharles
saw it, so at last did the general and
his wife. Edith herself, least of all, could
not be blind to devotion which had in it
much of the unswerving unquestioning attachment
of the dog that follows at one’s
heels. In all probability she would have
been overcome by it. Already that pity
which is proverbially akin to a much warmer
sentiment, had taken possession of her, and
she was in a fair way to be won had Herbert
pricked up courage to speak.</p>

<p>Edith’s parents were growing a trifle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[130]</a></span>
uneasy at Herbert’s attentions. The general
did not take much notice, but&mdash;a woman
is so much more worldly in these matters&mdash;Mrs.
Prioleau did.</p>

<p>‘Do you see, Robert,’ she said at length,
‘what is going on right under our noses?
Edith, I mean, and this Mr. Larkins?’</p>

<p>‘Well, I have had my suspicions. But
what matter? Cannot things take their
course?’</p>

<p>‘Agree to such a match for Edith?
Robert, you must be demented.’</p>

<p>The general had seldom seen his wife so
excited before.</p>

<p>‘He is a very rising young soldier.’</p>

<p>‘Who has already risen from the ranks.
It will never do. I have no false pride
about me, I think, but it is right to draw
the line somewhere. But even if there were
no other objections, that of means ought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[131]</a></span>
suffice. What are they to live upon? His
pay? Ridiculous and absurd.’</p>

<p>‘He cannot be dependent on his pay.
He lives well, keeps horses, and makes altogether
too good a show. I have heard
rumours of some rich old lady in the background,
who has made him her <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">protégé</i>.’</p>

<p>‘That story might not quite bear investigation,’
said Mrs. Prioleau drily. ‘We know
nothing about Mr. Larkins&mdash;where he comes
from, or to whom he belongs.’</p>

<p>‘I had no idea you were so keen, Sophia,
I confess I like the lad. However, speak
to Edith if you feel that it is necessary. I
leave it all to you.’</p>

<p>It was while Mrs. Prioleau waited her
opportunity that chance gave Herbert an
adverse rub.</p>

<p>Edith, with Captain Mountcharles as
escort, was returning from the Moorish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_132" id="Page_132">[132]</a></span>
Castle, when she came suddenly upon
Herbert Larkins. He was leaving a small
cottage, which was evidently a soldier’s
quarter. It was, in fact, the home of old
Sergeant Larkins and his wife.</p>

<p>‘Good bye, mother,’ Herbert was saying,
as the pair passed by.</p>

<p>‘Good bye, my boy; come again soon.
You are an honest lad not to forget us,
although you’ve come to be so great a
man.’</p>

<p>And with that the old woman kissed
him tenderly on the brow, although they
stood at the cottage door, almost in the
open street.</p>

<p>‘Whose quarter is that?’ the aide-de-camp
asked of a passing orderly, pointing
back, after they had ridden a little way on.</p>

<p>‘Sergeant Larkins’, sir. Principal barrack
sergeant, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">[133]</a></span></p>

<p>At which Mountcharles looked hard at
Edith, and with a comical face.</p>

<p>‘Well, what do I care? What is it to
me? It is quite proper of him. It is his
duty not to neglect his parents.’</p>

<p>‘Oh, of course. She’s a dear old thing,
too, I can see that. How would you like
her for a mother-in-law, Edith Prioleau,
eh?’</p>

<p>‘How dare you suggest such a thing,
Captain Mountcharles?’ cried Edith, blushing
red.</p>

<p>But there was a cold chill on her heart,
and Herbert’s chances seemed very small
just then.</p>

<span class="fs70">HERBERT ON HIS METTLE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Herbert was all unconscious that he had
been observed leaving the cottage near the
Moorish Castle; still more that he had
been overheard addressing Mrs. Larkins,
as of old, by the affectionate title of mother.
Had he heard what passed between Edith
and Captain Mountcharles upon that occasion
it might have modified his plans very
considerably. For now at length, after
much hesitation and delay, he had made
up his mind to speak to Edith on the first
opportunity, and tell her of his love. Matters
had long continued in this most unsatisfactory
state with him. He had suffered<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">[135]</a></span>
tortures; he had been continually in suspense,
for ever torn by hopes and fears.
One day he was in the seventh heaven, the
next in the very depths of despair. He
could do no work. Edith seemed to come
between him and his duty. He thought of
her always, everywhere. He was for ever
sketching her face upon the official blotting
pad in the orderly-room; he was all but
giving Edith as the countersign when challenged
by the sentries; he very nearly
mixed up her name with the words of command
upon parade.</p>

<p>Latterly, however, he had been in much
better heart. She did not encourage him,
perhaps, as much as he would have liked,
but she favoured him more, he thought, than
any of his fellows. Therefore it was that
he had brought himself up to the terrible
ordeal of staking his fate upon the throw;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">[136]</a></span>
and it was with this intention that he approached
Miss Prioleau the very next time
they met.</p>

<p>It was at a ball at the Convent, at the
well known palace or residence of the
Governor of the Rock. Edith was seated
upon a fauteuil in the <em>patio</em>, or central
courtyard, between the dances. Her companion
was Captain Mountcharles.</p>

<p>‘May I have the pleasure of a dance,
Miss Prioleau?’ Herbert asked.</p>

<p>‘I’m afraid I have none left.’</p>

<p>‘You promised me the second valse&mdash;quite
a week ago.’</p>

<p>‘Miss Prioleau is engaged for that to
me,’ put in Captain Mountcharles, rather
rudely.</p>

<p>‘The next, then?’ went on Herbert to
Edith, without taking any notice of the
A.D.C.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[137]</a></span></p>

<p>‘And for that too,’ said Mountcharles,
in much the same tone as before.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, I was speaking to Miss
Prioleau, and I trust she will give me the
answer herself.’</p>

<p>‘It’s quite&mdash;’ true she was going to say,
as the easiest way out of the thing. But
she was far too honest to tell a lie, even
about a dance, and besides there was a
mute appealing look in Herbert’s face which
went to her heart. ‘I mean that you are
rather late in the day, Mr. Larkins.’</p>

<p>She had promised not to dance with
him, that was the fact. There had been a
scene at the general’s about this Mr. Larkins,
as Mrs. Prioleau called him. Edith
had been taken rather sharply to task for
encouraging him, and both father and
mother had begged her to be careful. The
man wasn’t half good enough for her, they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[138]</a></span>
said. They had no absurd scruples about
birth and position, and all that, still she
ought to do much better than take a soldier
of fortune, about whom and his belongings
nothing whatever was known. Edith, remembering
the Moorish Castle adventure,
thought she could have enlightened her
parents as to Herbert’s belongings, but she
had no wish to injure him or to blacken
him in their eyes. She only hotly repudiated
the charge of favouring him, and
agreed readily to do anything they wished.
She would cut him if they liked. Not
necessary? Well, snub him then? Not
necessary either. What then? General
and Mrs. Prioleau declared they would be
satisfied if she would promise not to dance
with the objectionable pretender at the
Governor’s ball, and Edith gave her word
to that effect.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[139]</a></span></p>

<p>This was why she had received Herbert
so coldly. The other adventure had
weighed, perhaps, with her, but not
much.</p>

<p>As for Herbert, he was utterly taken
aback. What could be the matter with
Edith? Why this extraordinary change?
Was the girl capricious, a mere flirt, a garrison
belle, to whom admiration was everything,
and admirers or their feelings simply
nothing at all? Herbert did not like to
think so hardly of her all at once, and resolved
to make another attempt.</p>

<p>‘Is it quite hopeless, Miss Prioleau?
May I not have one dance, only one?’ again
he pleaded, with such earnest eyes that
Edith Prioleau was touched and on the
point of giving way.</p>

<p>‘Why did you cut me the other day,
Mr. Larkins?’ suddenly asked Captain<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[140]</a></span>
Mountcharles, with the idea of creating
some diversion.</p>

<p>‘I never cut you’&mdash;although I probably
shall, and the sooner the better&mdash;Herbert
was disposed to add. ‘When and where
was it?’</p>

<p>‘Near the Moorish Cottage; you were
coming out of some soldiers’ quarters.’</p>

<p>‘Oh yes, Sergeant Larkins.’</p>

<p>‘Relations, perhaps,’ the other observed
impertinently.</p>

<p>‘Very near and very dear,’ Herbert
replied promptly. This was not an occasion
on which he would deny his old friends.</p>

<p>‘At any rate you are honest, Mr.
Larkins,’ Edith said, with a frank smile,
but Herbert knew from the speech that
Edith had been also present, and he seemed
to understand now why she was so different
to him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[141]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Honesty is not the exclusive property
of high birth, Miss Prioleau, and I can claim
at least to have as much as my neighbours.’</p>

<p>‘Come, Edith, the music is playing,’
cried Captain Mountcharles, springing up;
‘we are losing half the dance.’</p>

<p>‘I’m not going to dance this,’ she replied
coolly, adding, as he stared at her with
indignant surprise, ‘I don’t care whether
you’re cross or not. Go and find some
other partners; there are plenty upstairs.
I mean to stay here. Mr. Larkins will take
care of me, I daresay.’</p>

<p>A quick flush of pleasure sprung to
Herbert’s cheek. She was relenting; she
did not mean to quarrel with him altogether.
Perhaps after all she had been
only trying him, and was ready to yield if
he only took heart of grace to speak up and
out to her like a man.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">[142]</a></span></p>

<p>Mountcharles, with a sulky snort and a
very savage look, had risen from his seat
and walked off, leaving Herbert considerably
elated, master of the field.</p>

<p>Our hero would have been less joyous,
perhaps, had he known Edith’s reason for
thus appearing to favour him. With the
native quick wittedness of a daughter of
Eve, she had guessed already what was the
matter with Herbert. A man who seeks to
disguise his feelings in the presence of the
woman he loves may flatter himself that he
plays his part to perfection, but it is generally
the flimsiest attempt even to ordinary
feminine eyes, most of all to those of the
beloved object. Edith had seen through
him from the first. She knew that he was
on the brink of a declaration, that he
needed but the slightest encouragement to
fall, metaphorically, even practically, at her<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[143]</a></span>
feet. It was better that he and she should
come to an understanding; that he should
realise, even at some pain to himself, as
well as to her, that they could only be
friends to each other, nothing more.</p>

<p>There was a certain amount of coquetry
in her fresh young voice and of archness in
her bright eyes as she looked up to him
and said,</p>

<p>‘Well, Mr. Larkins?’</p>

<p>He had been standing in front of her
for some minutes, seeming rather <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">gauche</i>
and stupid, and without uttering a word;
courage seemed to come to him at once
from her voice and look.</p>

<p>‘I was wondering whether you would
listen to me, Miss Prioleau, while I told
you a story&mdash;a long story&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘That depends. Is it interesting? Is
it founded on fact? What is it about?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">[144]</a></span></p>

<p>‘It will be as interesting as I can make
it. It is undoubtedly true, and it is all
about myself.’</p>

<p>‘Your own history?’</p>

<p>‘Yes, so far as I know it.’</p>

<p>She made no answer, but just moved
her skirts a little, with the gesture that
implied she wished him to sit by her side.</p>

<p>There were other couples in the <em>patio</em>,
patrolling or resting between the dances;
there might be many interruptions; there
certainly could be no privacy in this place,
and Herbert did not wish his confidences
published to all the world.</p>

<p>‘Shall we take a turn in the garden?’
Herbert asked, rather diffidently. ‘I
shall be able to speak more unreservedly
there.’</p>

<p>She nodded her head, and, getting up,
took his arm without a word.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">[145]</a></span></p>

<p>They passed out from the <em>patio</em> to the
Convent garden&mdash;a perfect paradise that
night for lovers. The moon was at its full&mdash;a
southern moon&mdash;and flooded every
place with warm white light; above was
the deep purple sky, and high into it rose
the steep crags of the great Rock. The
soft and mellow air was loaded with fragrance;
a wealth of southern flowers, all
now in their full bloom, filled the beds
about, and among them were great bushes
like trees of syringa, and of the <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">dama de
noche</i>, which only give forth their full perfume
at night. The sweet strains of an
excellent band, playing for the dancers in
the great ball-room up-stairs, rose and fell
like a distant echo, and added greatly to
the enchantment of the scene.</p>

<p>Walking here with the girl of his heart,
Herbert spoke eloquently and well. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">[146]</a></span>
told everything that had happened to him
from his earliest days. The poor home in
Triggertown barracks; the sudden appearance
of the great lady who had charged
herself with his education; the fine prospects
which seemed to open before him on
approaching manhood, and how they had
been suddenly ruined. He spoke feelingly
of the treatment he had received at the
hands of Sir Rupert Farrington.</p>

<p>‘Which you so nobly repaid,’ interjected
Edith.</p>

<p>He narrated the circumstances of his
birth and parentage, and expatiated upon
the affectionate devotion of old Mrs. Larkins,
who had been a second mother to him;
he touched lightly upon the chances which
were still his of obtaining a title to a large
estate and a good old name. He finished,
and waited to hear what she would say.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[147]</a></span></p>

<p>But she was silent, and for so long that
he feared she was annoyed.</p>

<p>‘You are not vexed? I have not bored
you, I hope?’ he said.</p>

<p>‘Oh, no, no; I was only thinking&mdash;thinking
how hardly you had been used&mdash;how
some of us, too, had misjudged you.’</p>

<p>She spoke in a low soft voice, which
thrilled through him.</p>

<p>‘You were not one of those, surely?
You, whose good opinion I value above all
earthly things? Oh, Miss Prioleau, there is
so much I have still to say to you that I
hardly know how to begin. Can you not
guess why I have told you my life? I wished
only to interest you in myself, to explain
why as yet I appear to be other than I really
am. I felt it necessary, because I feared
you despised me for my lowly birth&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘No, no, indeed, I never did that.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_148" id="Page_148">[148]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I knew it, I knew it, but I wished to
be perfectly sure. You are too good, Edith,
too honest to be swayed by mere class distinctions&mdash;’</p>

<p>He was suddenly and rather rudely interrupted
by the abrupt tones of General
Prioleau’s voice&mdash;</p>

<p>‘But I am not, Mr. Larkins, and the
sooner you know that the better. You
probably despise them, as you do those conventional
rules of propriety by which any
one of the gentleman class would be bound.’</p>

<p>The general spoke with great warmth.
There was no abatement in the angriness
of his tone as he turned to his daughter
and said,</p>

<p>‘Edith, your mother and I have been
looking for you for some time past. I hardly
thought to find you here and to see that
you have not kept your promise.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">[149]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I gave no promise; I never said I would
not speak to Mr. Larkins again,’ Edith said
stoutly, although her eyes were brimming
over with tears.</p>

<p>‘Gaston, give Edith your arm, and take
her back to her mother. I have a word or
two to say to this&mdash;<em>gentleman</em>.’</p>

<p>Herbert, however, had by this time
found his voice. He was brave enough
too and spoke up to the general, in spite
of their disparity in rank, as one man would
to another.</p>

<p>‘I am truly sorry, sir, to have acted in
a manner which is distasteful to you, but
I cannot admit that I deserve your harsh
words. I have done nothing wrong, sir&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Nothing wrong!’ repeated the general,
bitterly, ‘not in seeking to entrap the affections
of an inexperienced young girl? Nothing
wrong in inveigling her to compromise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">[150]</a></span>
herself with you by this long and
solitary <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">tête-à-tête</i>? Nothing wrong!’</p>

<p>‘I am deeply and sincerely attached to
your daughter, sir, and I wished to ask her
to become my wife.’</p>

<p>‘Was there ever such matchless effrontery?
<em>You? You</em> to aspire to my daughter’s
hand? What position could you give
her? what would you live upon?’</p>

<p>‘I am not utterly penniless; I have
good expectations; I have hopes indeed of
succeeding to a title&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘That of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">chevalier d’industrie</i>, I presume.
But this is sheer waste of time. I
know all about you&mdash;all I wish to hear&mdash;and
I want nothing further. Our acquaintance
must cease; I forbid you to enter my
house, or ever again to address my daughter.
I decline distinctly to hold any further
communications with you. If your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">[151]</a></span>
own good taste does not prompt you to
accede to my wishes, I must try to protect
myself and my family by other means.’</p>

<p>‘I will win her in spite of you, general,’
said Herbert, firmly and very coolly,
although his blood was up. ‘It is due to
myself to say that neither by word or deed
have I knowingly sought to entangle Miss
Prioleau in any engagement. She is under
no promise to me; I am not certain whether
she cares for me, even as a friend.
But if God but grants me strength and
health to fight my way, she shall one day
be my wife, and that in spite of you all.’</p>

<p>And he walked away, leaving General
Prioleau aghast at his impudence.</p>

<span class="fs70">ON THE TRAIL.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">General Prioleau was not the pleasantest
company the morning after the Convent
ball. Although commonly counted an easy-going
good-natured man, whom nothing
seriously ruffled for long, he was this day
evidently in the vilest of tempers. No one
liked to face him. His wife was well aware
of the cause of his anger, and in her own
lymphatic way approved it, but the general
had given her a very bad quarter of an hour
over the whole affair, and had openly told
her that if she had shown a little more
energy, and had kept a more vigilant eye
upon her daughter, any such <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">contretemps</i> as
this could not have occurred. Edith was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">[153]</a></span>
of course in utter disgrace. Her father
scowled at her at breakfast as though he
thought her guilty of the most heinous
court-martial offence, and should be immediately
brought to trial. When the aide-de-camp
came in he was taken to task for
various acts of omission and commission;
while the other members of the general’s
staff, who brought him documents to discuss
and papers to sign, found him utterly
impracticable and impossible.</p>

<p>What chafed him most, probably, was
that the chief offender was practically beyond
the reach of his rage. A general is
a great man within the limits of his own
command, but his powers are professional
merely, and scarcely extend to life and
limb. General Prioleau was really able to
inflict upon Herbert no stronger mark of
his displeasure than to cut him, and snub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[154]</a></span>
him, and refuse to grant him leave. He
might report unfavourably upon him in the
next confidential returns, but only by subordinating
his sense of duty to personal
pique, a line of conduct abhorrent to an
officer and an English gentleman, such as
General Prioleau undoubtedly was. What
would have pleased him best would have
been to order Herbert at once to leave the
Rock. Could not Colonel Greathed be
persuaded to send this pestilent young
fellow to the depot, and keep him out of
the way? Then the general remembered
that Mr. Larkins was adjutant&mdash;and a right
good adjutant&mdash;and that he could not be
transferred to the depot unless he voluntarily
resigned the appointment, which he
was little likely to do.</p>

<p>‘There is only one way out of it,’ he
said at last to his wife. ‘We must send<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">[155]</a></span>
Edith away. She shall go to England, to
her aunts, by the very next mail.’</p>

<p>‘You will be the chief sufferer by that.
You know you cannot bear to part with
the girl, even for an hour. But for that
she would have gone to school. I always
wished it. If she had, perhaps&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘You always wish things when it’s
too late to get them,’ replied the general,
testily. ‘However she shall go now. I am
angry with her and can spare her.’</p>

<p>All arrangements were laid accordingly,
and Edith was duly prepared for her journey
home. She did not quite object to go away,
but she consented with a very bad grace.
If this did not tend to mollify the general,
he was presently made far more angry by
what appeared to be the most audacious
pertinacity on the part of her lover.</p>

<p>Just within a day or two of Edith’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">[156]</a></span>
departure, Herbert Larkins also applied for
leave of absence to proceed to England on
very urgent private affairs.</p>

<p>The application had come before the
general in the usual way, presented to him
as a matter of course with a number of
other documents.</p>

<p>‘It’s the most exasperating piece of presumption
I ever heard of in all my life.
He shall not have it&mdash;not an hour!’</p>

<p>‘The commanding officer recommends
it, sir; a substitute is named; I really don’t
think&mdash;’ said the brigade-major, expostulating.
It is so unusual a thing for a
general officer to refuse leave which is
properly backed up and all according to
form.</p>

<p>‘What do I care about the colonel?
Does he command the brigade, or do I?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, of course it rests with you, sir;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">[157]</a></span>
still, to refuse it peremptorily and without
apparent reasons&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Without reasons, man? Don’t you
know that&mdash;?’ the general stopped short.
His brigade-major probably did not know
the family trouble, nor was there reason
why he should.</p>

<p>‘Telegraph up for Colonel Greathed
to come and see me, as soon as possible,’
the general said, abruptly. ‘I will speak
to him personally on the subject.’</p>

<p>The general had cooled down a little
by the time Colonel Greathed arrived.
He was quite cautious and diplomatic too,
speaking first of certain routine matters
before he approached the matter he had
really at heart.</p>

<p>‘I see your adjutant is asking for leave.
Are you sure you can spare him?’</p>

<p>‘Oh, I think so, sir.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[158]</a></span></p>

<p>‘I don’t quite like it, colonel. I have
really some hesitation about granting this
leave. I should be loth to find fault, but
your men are at their spring drills, they
want plenty of “setting-up;” they don’t
stand to their arms quite as I should like
altogether. I’m not finding fault, remember,
nothing is further from my mind. Still,
the adjutant’s eye is wanted just now, and
I don’t feel that it ought to be withdrawn.’</p>

<p>‘He is most anxious to go, sir. Private
affairs of some urgency require his personal
attention.’</p>

<p>‘He rose from the ranks, I believe; what
private affairs could he possibly have?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps you are not aware, general, of
Mr. Larkins’ history&mdash;that he is the adopted
son of an old lady of rank&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Surely there is no truth in that cock-and-bull
story?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">[159]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Pardon me, sir, it is perfectly true. I
have the pleasure of knowing the old lady&mdash;Lady
Farrington. Diggle, you may remember,
married a Farrington, but of
another branch.’</p>

<p>‘But this Mr. Larkins has no claim, I
suppose, to the name&mdash;nothing more than
a left-handed claim, I mean?’</p>

<p>‘I am not so sure. It may be difficult
to prove his case; but he has a case, and a
good one. At any rate, the old lady is
devotedly attached to him, and likes to see
him now and again. She has now written
pressing him most earnestly to pay her a
visit, thinking, I believe, that something
of importance is likely to turn up.’</p>

<p>‘Is this why he asks leave? Has he no
other reasons?’</p>

<p>‘None that I am aware of, except that
he thinks of competing at the next Staff<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_160" id="Page_160">[160]</a></span>
College final examination, and wishes to
see what it is like, so as to prepare in good
time.’</p>

<p>The general could not well withhold his
consent any longer; but he was resolved
now to keep Edith by his side. There was,
of course, no reason why she should leave
the Rock; on the contrary, the chances of
meeting Mr. Larkins on board the steamer
or in England must be as far as possible
avoided. The man was a forward fellow, as
reckless as he was presuming; who, it
was quite likely, would make opportunities
for prosecuting his suit. General
Prioleau was little less bitter against Herbert,
in spite of what Greathed had told
him; he could not possibly bring himself
to think of our hero as otherwise than an
ineligible and unsatisfactory <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parti</i>.</p>

<p>Herbert himself was also greatly excited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">[161]</a></span>
by what had occurred. He had only
seen Edith twice since the ball. She was
riding on the beach, closely guarded, the
general on one side, his aide-de-camp on
the other. Herbert had raised his hat, as
in duty bound, to his official superior, who
returned the salute formally. Captain
Mountcharles looked straight to his front,
and Edith bowed gravely and sadly, he
thought, in the short glimpse he caught of
her face. It was war, of course&mdash;to the
knife. The general’s animosity was all the
more plainly shown by his attitude about
the leave, for Colonel Greathed had given
Herbert an outline of his interview with
the chief.</p>

<p>‘I have a very shrewd notion what is
wrong with him,’ Greathed said; ‘I don’t
want you to tell me more than you choose,
Larkins, but I have eyes and ears, and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">[162]</a></span>
know pretty well what has been going
on.’</p>

<p>‘There is no secret in the matter, sir,’
and Herbert told his colonel exactly what
had happened at the ball.</p>

<p>‘You are evidently in earnest, Larkins,
and I wish you luck,’ said Greathed, laughing.
‘But I’m not surprised the general
was a little put out. And now what do you
mean to do?’</p>

<p>‘Stick to it to the last, sir. If I could
be only sure that she would wait. But in
a place like this, and with a man like
Mountcharles always close by,&mdash;I shouldn’t
be in the least afraid but for that.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a long lane that has no turning.
You must make your way in the service;
get upon the staff; lose no opportunity of
employment. Everything comes to the
man who is determined to win. Perhaps<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">[163]</a></span>
that other affair may turn up trumps.
Lady Farrington, you say, thinks that some
important evidence will soon be forthcoming?’</p>

<p>‘The dear old lady is always thinking
that, sir,’ said Herbert with a smile. ‘She’s
a little like the boy that cried wolf. There
have been so many false alarms that I
shan’t believe the real thing if it ever comes
to pass.’</p>

<p>‘Have you any idea what she is expecting
now?’</p>

<p>‘Not in the least. She gives me only
the vaguest hints. I half fancy it is only
an affectionate ruse to get me back to England
for a time.’</p>

<p>But it was something more than that,
as the reader will now see.</p>

<p>Some eleven months had elapsed since
the last advertisement had been published,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">[164]</a></span>
offering a large reward for information concerning
the marriage of Herbert Farrington
and Annie Orde, but no satisfactory
answer had been received. Hope was already
failing all but the sanguine old Lady
Farrington, who kept on declaring persistently
that the right would certainly prosper
in the end. As she was the only person
who stoutly maintained that proofs of the
marriage must certainly be forthcoming, so
she was the only one who was not surprised,
when one morning a mysterious
letter arrived from no one knew where,
and sent by no one knew whom.</p>

<p>It was addressed to Mr. Bellhouse, who
had long been the family’s solicitor, as well
as Lady Farrington’s, and consisted of only
a few lines scribbled, on the back of an old
invoice for goods:&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Those who seek find. Search the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">[165]</a></span>
registers of the parish of Stickford-le-Clay,
in the county of &mdash;&mdash;. He who was once
Herbert Farrington sends this.’</p>

<p>A communication which drove Lady
Farrington nearly frantic. It revived, and
indeed supported, all her old fancies, that
her injured son was still alive. She declared
that she recognised his handwriting;
she began once more, although a long interval
had elapsed, to hear his voice and to see
his beloved form in her dreams. She talked
incessantly about him and his probable
return. Had she not been carefully tended
and watched by her own servants, she
might have had a very serious relapse.</p>

<span class="fs70">A LAWYER’S LETTER.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Farrington Hall was an excellent specimen
of our sixteenth century domestic architecture.
It was a long low red-bricked
building, with white stone mullions, and it
stood on a gentle eminence, which dominated
the far-reaching, low-lying fat lands of
the Farrington estate. It had all the conventional
surroundings which confer dignity
on an old place; magnificent trees, in which
lived a prosperous colony of rooks; a great
park of velvety grass; a broad, slow stream
at the foot of the slope on which stood the
Hall.</p>

<p>There had been Farringtons of Farrington
from time immemorial. The transmission<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">[167]</a></span>
of the title and estates had long been
direct from father to son; only at rare intervals,
as in the case of the present baronet,
Sir Rupert, did distant relatives succeed.
But now at last the race was nearly run.
There were no males left, not even a far-off
cousin twenty times removed, and after Sir
Rupert’s death the title would be extinct.
There was an heir for the property certainly,
but only through the female branch. Letitia
Diggle would come into everything of
course, and after her, her children; but
although her eldest boy, under Sir Rupert’s
will, would probably assume the Farrington
name and arms, the baronetcy could
not be his, and in consequence Mrs. Diggle
was very much aggrieved.</p>

<p>The Cavendish-Diggles had by this
time taken up their residence at the Hall.
They came, in the first instance, by invitation,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">[168]</a></span>
but remained afterwards as a matter
of course. The old people liked to hear
the patter of their grandchildren’s feet and
their merry shrill trebles as they played
about the place. This had to some extent
dispelled the fixed gloom which had settled
on Lady Farrington after her son’s death.
Even black Sir Rupert was softened, and
seemed to take a pleasure in their prattle
and merry ways. But then Letitia had
always been an especial favourite of his.
Her cast of character was in harmony with
his. She reproduced many of his own
peculiar traits; she was as unforgiving, as
determined, and as hard. She showed
pretty plainly what she would be if she
lived to inherit the estates, and already exercised
a kind of second-hand authority,
such as heirs-apparent often usurp when
allowed. She knew the estate by heart,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">[169]</a></span>
every inch, every tenant. She had her own
views as to the rentals and the outgoings.
She kept a sharp look-out on the bailiff, and
gave him to understand that she was up to
every move. Sir Rupert, to a great extent,
let her have her own way. It pleased him
to think that the property would fall into
good hands, and Letitia’s ideas were so
much in accord with his own that they seldom
fell out or disagreed.</p>

<p>It was amusing to see how the great
Diggle comported himself at Farrington
Hall. He was a curious example of how
low the once mighty may fall. From
having been a tremendous personage he
had sunk to the position of a mere hanger-on.
He was not even prince consort to a
reigning queen. His wife looked upon him
as an appendage, a person useful in his
way, but not entitled to have any voice in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[170]</a></span>
the management of affairs, or, indeed, any
opinions of his own. He might have resented
this, and refused the rather ignominious
<em>rôle</em>, but for two reasons. The
first was that his health was very indifferent,
and he had no spirit to battle for his
rights; the second, that Mrs. Diggle had
made certain discoveries as to his family
and antecedents which left him very much
in her power. The fact was that Cavendish
really belonged to the great tea firm trading
and largely advertising under the name of
Diggle; and what was more, the firm was
in a very bad way. To have married a
Diggle at all was in itself a condescension,
but to have become the wife of a pauper
Diggle was something like a ‘sell.’ There
had been settlements, of course, but not to
a large amount, as Diggle declared he had
but little ready cash, although his prospects<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[171]</a></span>
were excellent. Moreover, his hopes, undoubtedly
well-grounded at the time, of
professional advancement, which had been
not the least potent inducement to the
match, were now fading into nothingness,
and there seemed every reason to fear that,
owing to his wretched health, Colonel Diggle
would continue a half-pay officer for the
rest of his life. A <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parvenu</i> who is poor and
without any chances of obtaining social distinction
has no <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">raison d’être</i> at all, and Diggle
was fast degenerating into a mere cipher,
a poor creature who had no other claims to
respect but that of being father to the
Diggle-Farrington who would some day be
the master of Farrington Hall.</p>

<p>They were at breakfast at Farrington
Hall one morning, when the post-bag arrived,
and, as usual, was opened at the
table. The letters were served out like<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">[172]</a></span>
alms, grudgingly given, by Sir Rupert to
each, but he still kept the lion’s share to
himself. All were soon deep in their
correspondence. Lady Farrington’s were
gossipy letters, filling several sheets; Letitia’s
the same, with a large sprinkling of
tradesmen’s circulars and bills. The colonel
heard only from old soldier friends, short but
often pithy notes, having mostly the same
refrain&mdash;the writer’s grievances or his forcibly
expressed conviction that the service
was going to the dogs. These last were the
soonest read, and Diggle was therefore the
only one free to notice what passed among
the others at table.</p>

<p>It was quite clear that Sir Rupert was
very much put out by his morning’s news.
Although little given to betray what was
passing in his mind, his demeanour after
he had opened and read the first few lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">[173]</a></span>
of one of his letters, was that of a man in
whom indignation, excitement, and ill-concealed
rage combined to considerably disturb.
His black eyebrows contracted, his
hard mouth was drawn down at the corners;
he looked up and around with fierce bloodshot
eyes, and as quickly looked down
again when he saw that he was observed by
Diggle. After that he ‘took a pull on himself,’
so to speak, and folding up the evidently
offensive missive, put it with the
others, then lapsed into moody, preoccupied
silence until the breakfast was over.</p>

<p>‘I should like to speak to you, Letitia,
in the justice room, as soon as you conveniently
can come.’</p>

<p>He often consulted her, and there was
nothing strange, therefore, in this request,
except in the abrupt and peremptory tone
in which it was made.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">[174]</a></span></p>

<p>The justice room, in which Sir Rupert
gave audience to constables and administered
the law when urgently required, was
also his library, study, and place of business.
It was a cheerless, formal, barely-furnished
room, which took, as rooms usually
do, the colour and temper of its occupant,
and was, like him, cold and uncompromising.</p>

<p>Sir Rupert seated himself at his official
table, in his high magisterial chair, and
sorting his letters carefully, selected that
which had so evidently disturbed him, read
and re-read it several times.</p>

<p>Then Letitia joined him&mdash;</p>

<p>‘Yes, father?’</p>

<p>‘Sit down please. What I have to say
will take some time.’ He paused&mdash;</p>

<p>‘A letter has reached me this morning
from Lady Farrington’s&mdash;the dowager’s&mdash;lawyer.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">[175]</a></span>
It may be all a hoax; let us hope
that it is; but I confess I am greatly disturbed
by what it says.’</p>

<p>Letitia looked at him, keenly interrogative,
but said nothing.</p>

<p>‘You remember, no doubt, the circumstances
of the old dowager’s craze? It was
no secret in the family. She pretended
that a grandchild of hers was in existence,
who was the rightful heir to the title and
estates; all that you knew, of course?’</p>

<p>‘I had heard the absurd story. Idiotic
old woman! I cannot understand why you
ever let her out,’ said Letitia, as though her
father had full powers to commit to durance
indefinite every individual likely to injure
the Farrington family or whose brain
was touched, the two being synonymous
terms.</p>

<p>‘I did not wish to let her out, I assure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">[176]</a></span>
you. It was done in spite of me, and by
the person who is, I believe, at the bottom
of the newest attempt to defraud us of our
rights.’</p>

<p>‘Are they threatened?&mdash;by whom?’
Letitia was like a lioness who, with her
whelps, was about to be robbed of her
prey.</p>

<p>‘The old lady, you must know, did not
fabricate her story without something to go
upon. There was some semblance of probability.
She produced the rightful heir&mdash;not
quite at the right time, perhaps, but
there he was.’</p>

<p>‘Did you meet him?’</p>

<p>‘I did; so did you; you knew him,
well.’</p>

<p>‘I, father? Preposterous; where, pray,
did we meet?’</p>

<p>‘He served as a private in the Duke’s<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">[177]</a></span>
Own. His name&mdash;the name he went by, at
least&mdash;was Larkins.’</p>

<p>‘Larkins! the sergeant? Poor Ernest’s
champion? Never!’</p>

<p>‘This Mr. Larkins whom I received
here at your mother’s express desire, whom
I treated with the utmost consideration,
proved a snake in the grass. He first
thwarted me with regard to old Lady Farrington’s
release from confinement; then,
with her, concocted a scheme of which I
have only to-day learnt the real intent.
This letter from the lawyers is nothing more
or less than a notice to quit&mdash;a regular
notice of ejectment, in favour of Herbert
Farrington, son of Herbert of the same
name, and grandson of the last baronet.’</p>

<p>‘It’s a swindle, of course, from beginning
to end; a trumped-up story. You won’t<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">[178]</a></span>
submit, father, I trust, to such a barefaced
imposition?’</p>

<p>Letitia was in arms at once; for the
threatened action struck at her more, perhaps,
than any one else.</p>

<p>‘I shall defend myself and you, you
may depend upon it. I shall not submit
tamely to any attempt at extortion. It is
really life and death to me.’</p>

<p>‘Is it not the same to me, and to my
children&mdash;to my Rupert, who some day will
be your heir? Are we to be robbed with
impunity? Certainly not.’</p>

<p>‘They have not told me much of their
case, of course; a mere outline, nothing
more. But it is evidently a strong one.
They have discovered, so they say, old Herbert
Farrington’s marriage&mdash;if it’s a <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">bonâ
fide</i> discovery we are bound to accept it,
after due verification, at least.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">[179]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What do they pretend?’</p>

<p>‘That the real Herbert Farrington,
when serving in the 12th Lancers as Corporal
Smith, married Ann Orde, and had
issue.’</p>

<p>‘This Larkins? Sergeant Larkins of
the Duke’s Own? I’ll never believe it;
not if I live to a hundred. But, father,
what do you mean to do? You will resist,
surely; for my sake&mdash;for that of my children,
you will not give in?’</p>

<p>‘If we could effect a compromise&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Never!’ cried Letitia. ‘Never, with
my consent. I protest against any compromise
at all.’</p>

<p>‘It might be wise.’</p>

<p>Was it possible that Sir Rupert had
reasons for dreading a law-suit? No one
knew more about the case than himself.
Was he in possession of any information&mdash;damaging<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[180]</a></span>
facts&mdash;which he had so far kept
secret, but which would be certain to come
out on a trial?</p>

<p>‘But a long law-suit! It would eat up
the whole estate. No doubt this pretender,
this Mr. Larkins, would gladly come to
terms. A few thousands paid on the nail
would silence him for good.’</p>

<p>‘Don’t, father; don’t dream of making
such concessions,’ Letitia almost shrieked.
The idea of parting thus coolly with thousands
out of the future heritage of her children!
‘No, no; better to fight it out, to
resist to the bitter end.’</p>

<p>‘I think I must consult your mother
and Conrad.’</p>

<p>‘What have they to say to it? I am
the person principally concerned&mdash;I and
mine&mdash;we shall be the greatest sufferers.’</p>

<p>‘Letitia,’ said her father very gravely<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">[181]</a></span>
to her, ‘it was not only to speak to you
concerning this letter that I asked you to
come here; it was to break some worse
news.’</p>

<p>‘Affecting us?’</p>

<p>‘Us all, but more particularly you.’</p>

<p>‘Go on; quick, father.’</p>

<p>‘Till very lately I had thought that
after me there would be an end of the Farringtons.
You would be sole heiress to
the estates, to which your children would
succeed, but the title would become extinct,
and the name, unless specially assumed.
Within the last month or two I have discovered
that I have a lawful male heir,
who must inevitably come between you
in the entail. Ernest, poor Ernest, left a
son.’</p>

<p>‘By that person, that woman? Father,
how dare you mention her name in my presence?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[182]</a></span>
What claims can such a creature as
her offspring have upon you?’</p>

<p>‘Poor Ernest married her, Letitia. There
is not a shadow of a doubt of it. The whole
of the proofs are in my possession. The
child I have not seen, and will not see. But
your mother has; indeed, the whole thing
has come out through her.’</p>

<p>‘Ernest was always her favourite,’ said
Letitia bitterly. It was being borne into
her gradually how much she was about to
lose. ‘But I shall not surrender my rights
except upon compulsion, father. We have
lawyers too, you must remember; and
where a large property is at stake, people
must look out for themselves.’</p>

<p>‘I wish, for your sake, the case was not
so clear.’</p>

<p>‘I am not at all satisfied as yet, father.
There will be two law-suits, perhaps; and I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[183]</a></span>
shall not accept any compromise, you may
depend.’</p>

<p>There was now a prospect of much discord
in the family at Farrington Hall.</p>

<span class="fs70">TAKING ACTION.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">There were great rejoicings in Vaughan-street
upon Herbert’s return. The house
was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">en fête</i>. It was lighted up as for a
grand entertainment; when the door was
opened men in smart livery were seen
ranged within the hall. Hanlon came out
first, and received Herbert as he descended
from his cab. He would have carried his
old comrade and master in bodily on his
shoulders; but as Herbert objected, ‘the
Boy’ contented himself with the portmanteaus.
At the foot of the stairs Miss
Ponting, with new ribbons in her cap, met
the traveller with a precisely-worded speech
of welcome, and led him to the drawing-room,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">[185]</a></span>
where the dowager awaited him.
She was dressed magnificently in dark velvet
and costly lace, amidst which gleamed
many diamonds of the finest water. This
was all in Herbert’s honour and of the
great occasion.</p>

<p>‘Hail, Sir Herbert Farrington! all
hail!’ cried the old lady, using the language,
but having little of the appearance
of a witch in <em>Macbeth</em>.</p>

<p>‘My dearest grandmother,’ Herbert said,
‘I am so glad to see you again, and looking
so well. Why, you are like a queen!’</p>

<p>‘I am a queen dowager receiving the
young king,’ she replied, as she made him
sit by her side. ‘Let me look at you well,
my sweet boy; you are my own son’s son.
I knew it; I felt it all along, and now there
is no longer any doubt, and you will soon
come into your own.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">[186]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Please, dear grandmother, be more explicit.
Is there anything new? You threw
out vague hints in your last letter; but I
am still quite in the dark.’</p>

<p>‘Light will soon be let in on you, my
sweet boy. At last, after all this dreary
waiting and long suspense, information has
reached Mr. Bellhouse&mdash;from the other side
of the grave, I believe&mdash;’</p>

<p>Herbert looked keenly at the dowager.
Was her mind again becoming unhinged?</p>

<p>‘I cannot account for it otherwise. The
letter was from my Herbert, my long-lost
Herbert. Of that I have no doubt; and is
he not dead, dead these many many years?
Mr. Bellhouse laughed at it, sneered at it
and the information it gave. Yet he was
wrong; his prejudices misled him. He
could not deny that there was something
in it all when we found that it put us on<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">[187]</a></span>
the right track. Now we have the only
evidence that was wanting to complete the
case.’</p>

<p>‘Not evidence of the marriage, surely?
Can it be possible that you have discovered
that?’</p>

<p>‘Authentic evidence of the marriage.’</p>

<p>And she told him the whole story as it
has been given in a previous chapter.</p>

<p>‘Now you understand, Herbert, why I
give you your title. It is yours, clearly,
by right. You must assume it at once.’</p>

<p>‘Not quite yet, I think,’ Herbert replied
gently, fearing his refusal might vex
her; ‘I would still rather wait. It would
look so foolish to have to go back again.
Suppose we do not gain our cause.’</p>

<p>‘But we must and shall win it; of that
I have not the shadow of a doubt.’</p>

<p>‘I trust in Heaven we shall,’ Herbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">[188]</a></span>
said, in a voice so earnest and yet so sad
that his good old friend, with a woman’s
unerring intuition, guessed that he was suffering
and sore at heart.</p>

<p>‘Something has happened to grieve
you, Herbert, dear? You have been ill-used;
you are unhappy? Tell me, at
once, every word.’</p>

<p>Herbert was willing enough. Young
men crossed in love generally ask for nothing
better than an appreciative and consolatory
listener.</p>

<p>‘You love her, truly, deeply, with all
your heart and soul?’ said the dowager,
when she had heard all about Edith Prioleau
from beginning to end.</p>

<p>‘Indeed I do, and have done so ever
since I saw her first.’</p>

<p>‘And you think she returns it?’</p>

<p>‘I cannot be quite positive, of course.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">[189]</a></span>
But I should be hopeful were I certain I
did not lose ground. But when one is miles
away, and there are so many others close
by her, encouraged and approved of by her
parents, and with ever so many opportunities,
I begin to be half-afraid. She may
give way; she may change her mind.
There is an old Spanish proverb, “The
dead and those gone away have no friends.”
She will soon forget me, perhaps; she may
have done so already.’</p>

<p>‘Stuff and nonsense!’ cried the old
lady, with great spirit. ‘“Faint heart”&mdash;you
know the rest&mdash;is a better proverb
than that. Win her! Of course, you shall
win her, as you will the law-suit, the title,
estates, and everything else.’</p>

<p>‘What does Mr. Bellhouse say? Is he
sanguine?’</p>

<p>‘You know what lawyers are;’ and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">[190]</a></span>
from this Herbert gathered that doubts and
difficulties still stood in the way, notwithstanding
Lady Farrington’s confident hopefulness.</p>

<p>‘Mr. Bellhouse is very tiresome at times.
He is a very self-opinionated man, almost
too slow and cautious for me. It was only
at my most earnest entreaty that he would
take any action at all.’</p>

<p>‘You have commenced the suit then?’</p>

<p>‘Yes; and given Sir Rupert notice to
quit,’ said the Dowager, rubbing her hands
in high glee.</p>

<p>‘Has he replied?’</p>

<p>‘He came here in person, but I would
not see him. Then he went to Mr. Bellhouse,
who declined to discuss the matter
with him. The last thing was a letter from
him, imputing the basest motives to all of
us, threatening a counter-action for conspiracy<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">[191]</a></span>
or something&mdash;and that’s where it
stands now. But with God’s help we shall
beat him, dear; we shall beat him, and he
will wish that he had given in.’</p>

<p>Next day Herbert paid an early visit to
Mr. Bellhouse in Lincoln’s Inn Fields, and
found the old lawyer, although in manner
cordial and kind, somewhat disheartening
in tone.</p>

<p>‘Do not expect too much, Mr.&mdash;shall I
still say Larkins? Yes? I agree with you,
it is so much better not to be premature.
Do not be over-confident, Mr. Larkins, I
beg of you; the disappointment would be
so bitter if we failed after all.’</p>

<p>‘Failure is quite on the cards, I presume?’
Herbert asked, coolly enough.</p>

<p>‘Unhappily, yes. There are flaws, not
many, but one or two serious ones, in the
chain of evidence. I have no moral doubt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">[192]</a></span>
myself that the marriage we have discovered
is truly that of your father and mother.
But moral proofs are not enough in a court
of justice. Our difficulty will be to establish
identity between this Corporal William
Smith and the missing Herbert Farrington.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Larkins will swear to him.’</p>

<p>‘She never knew him as Farrington.
All she can do is to describe the person she
knew as Smith, who ran off with her sister,
and we must compare her description with
that of Lady Farrington.’</p>

<p>‘But there was the letter addressed
and sent to Lady Farrington after my
mother’s death; surely that will go some
way?’</p>

<p>‘It is a strong presumption, I don’t
deny; but not necessarily sufficient, at least
to a British jury, when titles and large possessions<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">[193]</a></span>
are at stake. That was why I
counselled compromise.’</p>

<p>‘Was it rejected?’</p>

<p>‘Indignantly. Threats, moreover, were
used, as perhaps you have heard.’</p>

<p>‘Mrs. Cavendish-Diggle was at the
bottom of that, I suppose? She, as heir
apparent, would be a principal loser, supposing
things remained as they are.’</p>

<p>‘Are you not aware of the change in
her prospects? There is a lawful male
heir, independent of you, I hear. Ernest
Farrington left a son.’</p>

<p>‘A son? By Mimie? He married her,
then? Thank heaven for that! If, indeed,
it be true.’</p>

<p>‘There can be no question about it.
Mrs. Ernest Farrington is accepted by the
family, and the child Ernest is mentioned<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">[194]</a></span>
by Sir Rupert as a party to the forthcoming
suit.’</p>

<p>‘I wonder whether the old people, the
Larkins’, are aware of this? It will gladden
their hearts. I almost wish that we were
going no further with the case. They have
been such staunch friends to me always,
that I should be loth to oust their grandson.’</p>

<p>‘That is pure sentimentalism,’ said the
matter-of-fact lawyer. ‘There must be a
limit to that sort of thing, or the world
would come to an end.’</p>

<p>‘Well, perhaps so. When will the cause
come on for trial?’</p>

<p>‘That will depend. We have gone
through the preliminaries, but have asked
for time. I am most anxious to find out
more about the letter which gave us the
great news. Lady Farrington insists that
the writer was your father.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[195]</a></span></p>

<p>‘My father? Still alive?’</p>

<p>‘It seems incredible. But I am making
all possible inquiries. The letter, such as
it was, was scrawled upon the back of an
old invoice for goods. The invoice was for
powder and two shot guns, and the goods
were supplied by Messrs. Jan Steen, of
Pietermaritzburg, in Natal.’</p>

<p>‘Have you followed up that clue?’</p>

<p>‘To the best of my ability. I sent a
special messenger to the Cape of Good
Hope. His instructions were to trace the
invoice from Messrs. Jan Steen, if possible,
to the person who eventually received the
goods. It may take some little time to
ferret out, but I can trust Jimlett implicitly
in all such affairs. Of course, if we could
only produce Herbert Farrington, alias
Corporal Smith, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">in propriâ personâ</i>, the
case would be won.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[196]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Have you any news yet from Mr.
Jimlett?’</p>

<p>‘Only short business communications
reporting progress. In his last I was informed
that he had arrived at Pietermaritzburg,
and had easily come upon Messrs.
Jan Steen. That was where the real difficulty
began, of course.’</p>

<p>‘Did they help him in any way?’</p>

<p>‘They were not very cordial,’ he says;
‘they deal largely with the gun-runners, or
persons employed in the contraband trade
across the frontier of Natal. Their business
is a large one&mdash;a lucrative one, and
possibly dangerous. Hence Jimlett had to
overcome considerable reticence on their
part. They acknowledged their invoice&mdash;that,
indeed, it was impossible to repudiate&mdash;but
they decline to say to whom the
arms were supplied; indeed, they declare<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[197]</a></span>
they cannot, as all such goods pass through
many hands.’</p>

<p>‘And there the matter stands?’</p>

<p>‘For the present, yes. We must wait
patiently. I confess I have confidence still
in Jimlett, and feel sure he will unravel
the mystery if any man can. Perhaps we
shall hear more next mail.’</p>

<p>Nothing came, however&mdash;neither next
mail nor the one after. Meanwhile the
suit dragged itself slowly along, and went
through the usual phases and formalities.
At first it attracted but little notice from,
and excited but little interest in, the public.
The announcement in the daily papers that
a suit was pending which promised to be as
involved and interminable as the half-forgotten
Tichborne trial was classed with the
‘big gooseberry’ paragraphs of the ‘silly
season’ and treated with contempt. No<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[198]</a></span>
one read the short accounts which appeared
in the law notices; and it was not until the
spring term, when the case was duly
opened, that general attention was aroused.</p>

<p>There was an element of romance in it.
The young claimant&mdash;not in this case an
overgrown ex-butcher, but a gallant soldier
bearing the Queen’s commission and that
envied decoration the Victoria Cross&mdash;was
entitled to a certain respect, and soon won
the suffrages of the crowd. Nor was society
against him. Sir Rupert was not beloved
in his own walk of life. The great world
is generally indifferent, and often unjust,
but it is seldom very wrong in its estimate
of those who belong to it. Wicked people
may prosper well enough, and long be
fairly spoken of, but never if they are unpleasant
and disagreeable to boot. Sir
Rupert had all these bad traits, and was, in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[199]</a></span>
consequence, universally unpopular. His
character stood out all the blacker as the
case proceeded, and his treatment of the
Dowager Lady Farrington was set forth in
its true light; nor was he absolved from
harshness in his attitude towards Herbert
Larkins as a lad.</p>

<p>The law, nevertheless, was, as it seemed,
altogether on the side of the strong. The
claimant’s case was good so far as it went,
but, as was feared, there were several serious
flaws in it. Lady Farrington’s peculiarities
were brought out into somewhat
unfavourable prominence in the witness-box,
and elicited considerable merriment.
The cross-examining counsel made the
most of her craze, and turned her inside
out, so to speak, on the subject of claimants
in general and Herbert in particular. Mrs.
Larkins was so very stout and positive that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[200]</a></span>
her statements could not be shaken; but
after all, although hers was the evidence
most relevant, it was entirely uncorroborated
and unsupported. Not even Herbert,
with his undoubtedly honest bearing, could
turn the scale; and the case day after day
was going more and more in favour of Sir
Rupert, when all at once came a report
from Mr. Jimlett, which inspired the plaintiffs
with fresh&mdash;almost exaggerated&mdash;hopes.</p>

<span class="fs70">TURNING THE SCALE.</span></h2>


<p class="noindent">Late in the afternoon at Westminster.
The court occupied, as it had been these
months past, with the great Farrington trial.
It had already lasted so long that the counsel’s
opening address was almost forgotten;
yet nothing definite had come out. The
case for the claimant was approaching conclusion.
Mr. Netherpoint, Q.C., held on
bravely to the last. Like a true man he
was prepared to die game; but it was quite
clear that Mr. Quantlet, the leader on the
opposite side, was only biding his time to
smash Mr. Netherpoint and his case into
little bits.</p>

<p>Interest had flagged since the commencement<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[202]</a></span>
of the trial. It was felt that
the whole thing was rather a hollow affair,
which must presently collapse utterly.
Only the parties to the suit retained their
anxiety. Lady Farrington, like the old
lady in Jarndice <em>v.</em> Jarndice, sat near Herbert,
and still strove, but in vain, to be calm.
Sir Rupert Farrington was also in court, his
dark face wearing an implacable frown,
which deepened as his eyes rested upon the
unscrupulous aggressors who sought to rob
him of his rights and all he possessed. Herbert
Larkins met his glance without quailing,
but without any particular buoyancy
of expression. He was, in truth, growing
a little hopeless, and almost wished the case
at an end. Everybody else seemed heartily
sick of the thing. Even the presiding
judge had yawned distinctly three times in
as many minutes; after which he asked his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[203]</a></span>
brother Netherpoint when he hoped to conclude.</p>

<p>‘Very shortly, m’lud; there are but two
or three additional witnesses&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Material witnesses, I trust? persons
prepared to give evidence relative to the
issue?’</p>

<p>‘Most decidedly, m’lud, most decidedly.
There is Reuben Bosher, and&mdash;hey? what
d’ye mean? I cannot hear what you say.’</p>

<p>This was to Mr. Bellhouse; who had
come behind him, and was whispering
rather excitedly, for him, in the counsel’s
ear.</p>

<p>‘Delay? impossible. They wouldn’t
give us an hour. Out of the question.’</p>

<p>Then a few more hurried words passed
between the lawyers; but further conversation
was rendered impossible by the impatience
and irritability of the judge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[204]</a></span></p>

<p>‘What is the meaning of this interruption?
It is not to be tolerated. How much
longer, may I ask, brother Netherpoint, do
you propose to occupy the time of the
court? If you have nothing further to
bring forward I must beg of you to sit
down.’</p>

<p>‘Very important intelligence, m’lud, has
arrived; evidence which will probably
change the whole complexion of the case.
We have just heard of a witness whom I
shall require to call&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘Is he in attendance?’</p>

<p>‘No, m’lud.’</p>

<p>‘Then he ought to be. We cannot have
the time of the court wasted any more.
You have had plenty of opportunities; if
you lose them it is your own affair.’</p>

<p>‘This witness has only just been heard
of, m’lud&mdash;’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">[205]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Psha! I shall insist upon your proceeding
with the case.’</p>

<p>‘We must move, then, m’lud, for a fresh
trial.’</p>

<p>‘Who and what is this witness? and
why is he not here?’</p>

<p>‘He is not here because there has not
been time to bring him, m’lud. He has
been at the Cape of Good Hope for nearly
thirty years; far back in the wilds, or <em>veldt</em>,
as it is called. I believe&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘What is his name?’</p>

<p>Mr. Netherpoint paused and looked
round, so as to give everyone full opportunity
of hearing what he said.</p>

<p>‘His name, m’lud, is Sir Herbert Farrington.’</p>

<p>There was a sensation in the court.</p>

<p>Lady Farrington, with a half-stifled
shriek, seized Herbert convulsively by the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">[206]</a></span>
hands, and ejaculating ‘I knew it, I knew
it,’ swooned away. Sir Rupert Farrington,
as he still claimed to be called, half rose in
his seat, as if determined to protest against
this new and most audacious attempt at
fraud; there was a flutter of excitement, a
murmur of voices in the body of the court,
the solicitors whispered and winked significantly
to one another, and the bar generally
woke up to give attention to what had
long been a threadbare and uninteresting
affair.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, the judge had been scanning
his notes assiduously; Sir Rupert’s counsel
and solicitors had been equally busy with
brief and papers, while Mr. Netherpoint
and Mr. Bellhouse had continued in close
confabulation, and interchanging memoranda
and ideas.</p>

<p>‘Sir Herbert Farrington?’ the judge<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">[207]</a></span>
asked, at length, snappishly and garrulously.
‘There is no such person in existence
that I am aware of, at present. The
young gentleman, who is one of the plaintiffs,
has no right to the title until he has
proved his claim&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘I do not speak of him, m’lud, but of
his father.’</p>

<p>‘The father is dead. He disappeared a
generation ago,’ said Mr. Quantlet, rising.</p>

<p>‘Pardon me, that assumption is entirely
unwarrantable,’ replied Mr. Netherpoint.
‘We undertake to prove the contrary, and
will produce the man himself.’</p>

<p>Mr. Quantlet sat down, grumbling loudly.
The words ‘personation,’ ‘conspiracy,’
‘trumped-up witnesses,’ were heard audibly
among his complaints.</p>

<p>‘Where is this person?’ asked his lordship.
‘Be good enough to inform the court<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">[208]</a></span>
of all particulars, brother Netherpoint. If
you spring a mine like this without giving
warning, you owe it to the court to make
the fullest explanation.’</p>

<p>‘I am quite ready, m’lud. You shall
have the whole story.’</p>

<p>What is now to be told so closely concerns
our hero, that it must be given at
some length.</p>

<p>After much delay and many rebuffs,
Mr. Jimlett’s inquiries had been crowned
at length with success. Tracing the line
which the gun-runners commonly took, he
had been gradually drawn towards the frontier
of Natal. While hesitating to pass beyond
the boundary, rumours reached him
of Englishmen settled among the native
tribes; of one in particular, who had risen
to some eminence among them, and was
reputed rich in wives and cattle. This personage<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[209]</a></span>
he thought might give him some
information; and, not without delay and
difficulty, he made his way to his kraal.
The object of Jimlett’s inquiries was stated
with some caution to the English settler,
who had been so long resident in his savage
home, that he was almost denationalised.
But if the chief had lost many of the customs
of civilised life, just as he had discarded
the dress, he had assumed in place
of it much of that wily caution peculiar to
the savage. Jimlett could get nothing out
of him for a long time. The chief displayed
as much, if not more circumspection than
the lawyer’s clerk. It seemed impossible
to draw a word out of him. He still spoke
English fluently, and was perfectly calm
and self-possessed.</p>

<p>‘I don’t see what you are driving at,’ he
said, after long fencing. ‘Why not throw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">[210]</a></span>
your cards down, and be open with me?
It’s the best way to deal with a wild man.
Who are you looking for really, and why?’</p>

<p>‘I want some one to tell me whether
Herbert Farrington, youngest son of the
last baronet Farrington, is alive or dead.’</p>

<p>‘But why?’</p>

<p>‘To take up the title and the family
property, and see that his son comes into it
after him.’</p>

<p>‘His son? He had no son.’</p>

<p>‘How do you know?’</p>

<p>‘His mother died in childbirth; she&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘You seem very fully informed. What
more do you know?’</p>

<p>‘Nothing&mdash;I wish I did.’</p>

<p>‘You have never sought to know, perhaps?
Had no business to know?’</p>

<p>‘Perhaps not. Is Lady Farrington still
alive?’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">[211]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Certainly; but the title is held by Sir
Rupert&mdash;’</p>

<p>‘The cousin? I don’t know how many
times removed. What right had he to it?’</p>

<p>‘He was the heir-at-law.’</p>

<p>‘Why did Lady Farrington drive her
son from home by ill-usage? Poor Herbert!
No wonder he fled.’</p>

<p>‘She has regretted it bitterly. She is
now doing her utmost to retrieve the wrong
she has inflicted. She has welcomed, educated,
and been a staunch friend to Herbert’s
son. Now that the marriage between
Herbert and Ann Orde is proved, another
link or two is all we need to establish the
younger Herbert as the rightful owner of
the title and estates.’</p>

<p>‘He cannot be quite that&mdash;not just yet.
His father, the long-lost Herbert Farrington,
is still alive.’</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[212]</a></span></p>

<p>‘Where is he to be found? Will you
take me to him? You shall be liberally
rewarded.’</p>

<p>‘I want no reward, and you need not
go far. I am the man.’</p>

<p>This was the overwhelming evidence
which Mr. Netherpoint proposed to bring,
and for which he claimed time from the
court. It was conceded, and the case was
held over to the following term.</p>

<p>Meanwhile gossip busied itself once
more with the case. The news of the missing
son was freely discussed. Opinions differed
very widely. Some held stoutly that
he was the man himself; others that barefaced
imposture was meant, and would in
the long run be brought home to the parties
concerned. It was a repetition of the
great Tichborne case, although on a much
smaller scale. Then the so-called Herbert<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[213]</a></span>
Farrington appeared, at first gaunt, wild,
unkempt, from his long life in the bush,
but unmistakably a gentleman still, and
soon resuming the manners and tone proper
to his birth and class. He was recognised
at once by all survivors. Mr. Bellhouse
knew him and could swear to him;
so could Mrs. Larkins; the rector of Stickford-le-Clay
had no doubt as to his identity.
Last of all his mother, whose injustice
had driven him forth, fell into his arms,
imploring his forgiveness, and declared he
was hardly at all changed.</p>

<p>He was in truth her own son. Like her
impressionable, flighty, sometimes strange
in his demeanour and ways. His whole
life was indeed an evidence of these inherited
traits. Another less sensitive nature
would have given in sooner; but he
so bitterly resented his mother’s harshness,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">[214]</a></span>
that he would never bring himself to hold
out his hand to her first. Then in his loneliness
and isolation after his wife’s death, of
which he had been informed, he broke altogether
with the world, and flew to the wilds,
from which, as we have seen, he was brought
back with extreme difficulty at the eleventh
hour.</p>

<p>But he arrived in time to turn the scale,
and secure victory for his son’s cause.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Within a month or two of the termination
of the trial, Herbert Farrington, bearing
now his proper name, returned to the
Rock. He was something of a celebrity, as
the hero of a great trial which had been decided
in his favour, and altogether a different
person from the unknown Larkins who
had aspired so high. He was well received&mdash;with
one exception&mdash;on every side. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">[215]</a></span>
was <em>fêted</em> and made much of in his own
regiment, and received cordial congratulation
through the garrison and wherever he
went. But General Prioleau was for a long
time unforgiving. When an easy-natured
man is embittered against any one, he is
perhaps more persistent in his dislike than
if his temper were more harsh. For a long
time he held out against Herbert, and closed
his doors to him. But continual dropping
will wear a stone; and Mrs. Prioleau, who
had now completely changed in her views
with regard to Herbert, kept up a continuous
flow of eulogistic words, before which
the general gradually succumbed. How
could he hope to hold his garrison when
there were traitors within? He might refuse
to see Herbert; but Mrs. Prioleau and
Edith met him elsewhere, and the love-making
went on in spite of him, under his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">[216]</a></span>
very nose. Edith, too, when taxed with
her misconduct, so plainly gave her father
to understand that she would marry Herbert
Farrington, and no one else, that the
general was compelled at length to give
way.</p>

<p>The marriage took place the same year.
Captain Mountcharles felt it as a personal
affront, and resigned his appointment, so
Herbert was presently made aide-de-camp
in his place. By degrees the general has
been entirely won over by his son-in-law’s
devotion to his duties, and brought, although
tardily, to acknowledge his worth. Nothing
will induce Herbert to resign his profession.
His regimental promotion is assured, and
as he is keen to take active employment
wherever it offers&mdash;a desire in which Edith,
a true soldier’s wife, always encourages
him&mdash;he is certain to rise in the service and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_217" id="Page_217">[217]</a></span>
take high honours eventually as a thoroughly
deserving ‘Son of Mars.’</p>

<p>Only a few words are needed to dispose
of the remaining characters in this story.</p>

<p>It seemed as though old Lady Farrington
felt, when the law-suit was won, that
her mission was ended. She died happily,
at peace with every one, in the following
year. Her son, the new baronet, Sir Herbert
Farrington, settled at the Hall for a
time; but restlessness soon took possession
of him, and he pined for the wilds which
had so long been his home. When last
heard of by his son Herbert he was at the
head of an exploring party somewhere near
Lake Tanganyika, and meant to be absent
for some years.</p>

<p>As for Mr. Rupert Farrington, he retired
into obscurity to eat out his heart with
envy, hatred, and all uncharitableness. He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">[218]</a></span>
was not overburdened with cash; but
through young Herbert’s good offices a
moderate allowance was made him from
the estate, which was to be continued to
the little Ernest, Mimie’s son. The Diggles
also sank in <em>prestige</em>, and had to be contented
with the modest income of a half-pay
lieut.-colonel, for the great Cavendish’s
private means disappeared in the crash of
the tea mart, and Letitia has led him a
terrible life ever since.</p>

<p>Last of all, brave old Sergeant Larkins
and his worthy wife found themselves established
comfortably on a corner of the Farrington
estate, where the former grows
roses, and the latter points with pride to
the boy she once befriended and who now
returns her kindness a thousandfold.</p>
